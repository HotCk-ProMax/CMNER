The hilarious show will answer life\u2019s most pressing questions \u2014 from how to get out of quicksand to how to get out of an awkward conversation at a party.\n\nChillag and Danforth will gather ideas from listeners and create episodes filled with interesting conversations, some of which will answer the questions, and some of which will not. Each episode will aim to answer mundane questions with the most overqualified people possible. This season includes memorization tips from a soap opera legend, a mayor in Italy bringing sunlight to his town for the first time in centuries and something called The Nasal Ranger.\n\nListen to the trailer here.\n\n\u201cI love working with Ian, and How To Do Everything is our baby,\u201d says co-host Mike Danforth. \u201cWait Wait is also our baby, and I don\u2019t want to pick favorites, but I love working with Ian on our favorite baby, How To Do Everything. My favorite part of the show is hearing questions from listeners. Do cows have different accents? Do I smell? These are actual questions we\u2019ve tried to answer.\u201d\n\n\"It's really nice how easy it's been getting back into making How To,\" says co-host Ian Chillag. \"It's like riding a bike. Which is something we once taught a grown man to do on the show. I hope he's still alive.\"\n\nHow to Do Everything launched in the halcyon days of podcasting and ran from 2011 to 2016. The 2024 version of the podcast will debut new episodes along with some of the very best from the archives.\n\nHow to Do Everything will be published weekly on Wednesdays in the How to Do Everything feed, and every other Wednesday in the Wait, Wait\u2026 Don\u2019t Tell Me! feed.\n\nWait Wait\u2026Don\u2019t Tell Me!+ supporters will get to hear both How to Do Everything and Wait Wait\u2026Don\u2019t Tell Me! without sponsors, and they will also get bonus episodes from Wait Wait\u2026Don\u2019t Tell Me!, featuring exclusive games, behind the scenes content, and more. More details available at plus.npr.org/waitwait.\n\nAbout Mike Danforth\n\nMike Danforth is the executive producer of Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! He lives in Chicago with his family. Mike and Ian previously hosted the TV rewatch podcast In The Scenes Behind Plain Sight. At his most recent physical, the nurse described Mike as \u201c6'1\u201d; not 6\u2019 as he\u2019d believed his entire adult life.\n\nAbout Ian Chillag\n\nIan Chillag is a writer and producer based in Brooklyn, NY. He is the senior producer of Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! and the creator and host of the award-winning Radiotopia podcast Everything is Alive. He works across all media, and his work has appeared in McSweeney\u2019s, the New York Times, A Public Space, Pop-Up Magazine, and, seriously, the German-language official quarterly of the Bavarian National Opera.\n\nAbout NPR\n\nNPR's rigorous reporting and unsurpassed storytelling connects with millions of Americans every day \u2014 on the air, online, and in person.
