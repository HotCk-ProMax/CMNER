In	O
January	O
2021,	O
Leahruth	B-PER
Jemilo	I-PER
and	O
three	O
friends	O
decided	O
to	O
book	O
a	O
weekend	O
getaway.	O
Jemilo	B-PER
was	O
having	O
a	O
tough	O
week	O
at	O
work,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
Friday	O
before	O
the	O
trip,	O
she	O
didn’t	O
know	O
if	O
she	O
could	O
go.	O
“My	O
tank	O
was	O
completely	O
empty,”	O
Jemilo	B-PER
said.	O
She	O
called	O
her	O
friends	O
to	O
cancel.	O
Sponsor	O
Message	O
“I	O
was	O
crying	O
to	O
them	O
saying,	O
‘I'm	O
so	O
anxious.	O
I'm	O
just	O
exhausted	O
from	O
the	O
week.	O
I	O
just	O
don't	O
think	O
that	O
I	O
even	O
have	O
the	O
energy	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
the	O
car,’”	O
she	O
remembered.	O
“And	O
they	O
said,	O
‘Do	O
it,	O
just	O
get	O
in	O
the	O
car.’	O
So	O
I	O
listened	O
to	O
my	O
girlfriends,	O
got	O
in	O
the	O
car	O
and	O
started	O
driving.”	O
As	O
she	O
drove	O
down	O
the	O
highway,	O
Jemilo	B-PER
started	O
to	O
cry.	O
She	O
put	O
on	O
her	O
sunglasses	O
to	O
hide	O
her	O
tears,	O
and	O
pulled	O
up	O
to	O
a	O
toll	O
booth	O
at	O
the	O
Chicago	B-LOC
Skyway	I-LOC
Toll	I-LOC
Bridge.	I-LOC
Then	O
she	O
noticed	O
her	O
toll	O
collector.	O
"She	O
had	O
these	O
really	O
beautiful,	O
very	O
bright	O
purple	O
long	O
braids	O
in	O
her	O
hair,	O
and	O
was	O
wearing	O
these	O
incredible,	O
really	O
long	O
purple	O
feather	O
earrings,”	O
Jemilo	B-PER
recalled.	O
The	O
worker	O
said	O
hello,	O
and	O
asked	O
Jemilo	B-PER
how	O
she	O
as	O
doing.	O
“And	O
I	O
immediately	O
burst	O
into	O
tears	O
and	O
I	O
said,	O
‘I	O
am	O
actually	O
not	O
good.	O
I	O
am	O
really	O
not	O
good.’”	O
Jemilo	B-PER
took	O
off	O
her	O
sunglasses	O
and	O
tears	O
streamed	O
down	O
her	O
face.	O
Then	O
the	O
toll	O
collector	O
said	O
something	O
to	O
her	O
that	O
she	O
won’t	O
forget.	O
“She	O
looked	O
at	O
me	O
and	O
her	O
eyes	O
were	O
so	O
kind.	O
And	O
she	O
pointed	O
her	O
finger	O
at	O
me	O
and	O
she	O
said,	O
‘Listen,	O
I	O
got	O
you,	O
girl.	O
You're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
my	O
prayers.	O
And	O
everything	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
OK,’”	O
Jemilo	B-PER
said.	O
“My	O
tears	O
actually	O
dried	O
up	O
when	O
she	O
said	O
that.	O
And	O
I	O
felt	O
lighter	O
in	O
that	O
moment.”	O

thanked	O
the	O
woman,	O
paid	O
the	O
toll	O
and	O
went	O
on	O
her	O
way.	O
Then	O
she	O
found	O
herself	O
crying	O
again	O
—	O
this	O
time	O
with	O
tears	O
of	O
happiness.	O
“Her	O

in	O

to	O
what	O

a	O

was	O

to	O

in	O

Jemilo	O

“It	O
was	O
