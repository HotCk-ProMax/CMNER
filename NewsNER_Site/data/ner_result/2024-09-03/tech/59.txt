Let's	O
say	O
you're	O
at	O
a	O
restaurant	O
with	O
a	O
group	O
of	O
friends.	O
You	O
ordered	O
appetizers,	O
maybe	O
got	O
a	O
bottle	O
of	O
wine	O
for	O
the	O
table,	O
went	O
all	O
in	O
for	O
dessert	O
...	O
then	O
the	O
bill	O
arrives.	O
No	O
one	O
is	O
offering	O
to	O
cover	O
the	O
whole	O
tab.	O
So	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
handle	O
the	O
check?	O
Do	O
you	O
split	O
it	O
evenly	O
among	O
everyone	O
at	O
the	O
table?	O
What	O
if	O
you	O
only	O
got	O
a	O
salad	O
while	O
your	O
buddy	O
got	O
the	O

Splitting	O
the	O
bill	O
is	O

Scenario	O
1:	O
I	O
arrived	O
to	O
dinner	O
late.	O
Everyone	O
at	O
the	O
table	O
already	O
ordered	O
drinks	O
and	O
appetizers	O
and	O
are	O
about	O
to	O
order	O
their	O
entrees.	O
What	O
should	O
I	O
do?	O
When	O
you're	O
ready	O
to	O
order,	O
tell	O
your	O
server	O
you	O
want	O
your	O
food	O
and	O
drinks	O
on	O
a	O
separate	O
check,	O
says	O
Aranita.	O
"It's	O
easier	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
than	O
having	O
to	O
split	O
a	O
check	O
in	O
complicated	O
percentages	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
night."	O
If	O
you	O
do	O
choose	O
separate	O
checks,	O
tell	O
your	O
server	O
that	O
at	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
the	O
meal,	O
not	O
the	O
end.	O
That	O
way	O
they	O
can	O
make	O
note	O
of	O
everyone's	O
individual	O
orders.	O
Not	O
every	O
establishment	O
offers	O
this	O
option,	O
but	O
it	O
doesn't	O
hurt	O
to	O
ask.	O
Scenario	O
2:	O
Everyone	O
ordered	O
alcohol	O
except	O
me	O
—	O
and	O
now	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
split	O
the	O
tab	O
fair	O
and	O
square!	O
Speak	O
up,	O
says	O
Aranita.	O
"Just	O
be	O
like,	O
'Hey	O
guys	O
—	O
I	O
didn't	O
drink.'	O
Usually,	O
that's	O
enough	O
for	O
everyone	O
to	O
reconfigure	O
the	O
bill	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
fairer.	O
The	O
problems	O
only	O
arise	O
when	O
you	O
don't	O
speak	O
up."	O
If	O
you	O
are	O
ordering	O
round	O
after	O
round	O
of	O
$20	O
cocktail	O

be	O

the	O
people	O
in	O
your	O
party	O

you.	O

Scenario	O
3:	O
We're	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
six.	O
Is	O
it	O
OK	O
to	O
ask	O
the	O
server	O
to	O
split	O
the	O
check	O
six	O
ways?	O
Many	O
restaurants	O
now	O
have	O
updated	O
point-of-sale	O
systems	O
that	O
make	O
it	O
easier	O
for	O
servers	O
to	O
split	O
the	O
check	O
in	O
myriad	O
ways,	O
says	O
Aranita.	O
But	O
it	O
doesn't	O
always	O
mean	O
you	O
should	O
ask	O
them	O
to	O
do	O
so.	O
Aranita,	O
who	O
has	O
also	O
been	O
a	O
bartender	O
and	O
server,	O
recommends	O
a	O
maximum	O
of	O
two	O
to	O
four	O
credit	O
cards.	O
Servers	O
"have	O

with	O
a	O

on	O
a	O

night.	O
And	O
running	O
several	O
cards	O
with	O
different	O
tip	O

ideal.	O
"If	O
you're	O
a	O

It's	O
my	O
birthday.	O
My	O
friends	O
should	O
pay	O
for	O
my	O
meal,	O
right?	O
In	O
American	O
culture,	O
it's	O
assumed	O
that	O
if	O
your	O

take	O
you	O
out	O
to	O
dinner	O
for	O
your	O
birthday,	O
they	O
will	O

that's	O

don't	O

You	O

So	O
in	O
this	O

put	O
down	O
your	O
card	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
meal.	O
Your	O
dining	O
mates	O
may	O
pick	O
up	O
your	O
tab,	O
but	O
if	O
they	O
don't,	O
"that's	O
perfectly	O
fine.	O
You're	O
saying:	O
'I	O
can	O
celebrate	O
me	O

also	O
pay	O

me.'	O

We're	O
all	O

the	O
