what	O

one	O

may	O
not	O
work	O
in	O
another.	O
That's	O
how	O
you	O
end	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
beautiful	O
round	O
table	O
that	O
looks	O
lost	O

your	O
long,	O
rectangular	O
dining	O
room,	O
says	O
Tan.	O
"It's	O
too	O
fat,	O
it's	O
too	O
short	O
and	O
it	O
doesn't	O
fill	O
up	O
the	O
space."	O
When	O
designing	O
a	O
room,	O

goal	O
is	O
to	O
optimize	O

keep	O

a	O
