    "text": "'Hillbilly Elegy' is back in the spotlight. These Appalachians write a different tale\n\ntoggle caption Bill Tompkins/Getty Images/Michael Ochs Archives\n\nHillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis, the 2016 memoir from Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, once again began flying off the shelves after former President Donald Trump named Vance as his running mate. Many have turned to the memoir to find out the story of Vance\u2019s upbringing, a core part of why he\u2019s on the Republican ticket to begin with. But the book also brings along a host of assumptions that many authors still find not to be true.\n\nPulitzer-winning author Barbara Kingsolver said she felt that it was her duty to tell a different story of Appalachian life than the one that Vance presented in the book.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cIt used the same old victim-blaming trope. It was like a hero story: \u2018I got out of here, I went to Yale,\u2019\u201d Kingsolver said of Vance. \u201c\u2018But those lazy people, you know, just don't have ambitions. They don\u2019t have brains. That\u2019s why they\u2019re stuck where they are.\u2019 I disagree. And that\u2019s my job, to tell a different story.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s has been mired in controversy since its 2016 publication, especially by authors who cover the region. Vance, who writes that Appalachian culture \u201cencourages social decay instead of counteracting it,\u201d says this upbringing is central to his political ideology and thinking.\n\nMany Appalachian authors, like Kingsolver, have worked tirelessly to combat what they feel is a misleading and even harmful depiction of the region. Her novel Demon Copperhead, a fictional window into the same communities, was named one of the New York Times\u2019 best books of the century just days ahead of the Republican National Convention. Last year, it won a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nAs hundreds of thousands more read about the plights of the Appalachian region, these authors are fighting back against what they describe as Vance\u2019s assumed norms.\n\nOvercoming \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d\n\nVance writes in Hillbilly Elegy that he grew up most of his life in Middletown, Ohio, but spent summers and his free time until the age of 12 in Jackson, Ky. Vance adds that Jackson \u201cwas the one place that belonged to me.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nVance\u2019s first stop after the RNC was to a rally in Middletown, where he declared, \u201cI love every one of you, and I love this town, and I'm so grateful to have been formed by it, because I wouldn't be who I was without it.\u201d\n\nBut Vance\u2019s claim to the area has created a cultural rift between him and those from Appalachia.\n\nKingsolver said that when she saw Vance\u2019s recently resurfaced interview calling several Democrats \u201cchildless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they\u2019ve made,\u201d it reaffirmed her disappointments with Hillbilly Elegy.\n\n\u201cWhen I read JD Vance\u2019s memoir, I resented it all the way through. There was just something about it that kept telling me, he\u2019s not from here, he doesn\u2019t get us,\u201d Kingsolver told NPR. \u201cI thought, OK, you are not from here because when I think about my childhood, many of the most important women in my life who saved me, who took care of me, were childless women. It\u2019s not just blood that defines community here.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s not just Kingsolver who has an alternate narrative.\n\nMeredith McCarroll and Anthony Harkins co-edited Appalachian Reckoning: A Region Responds to Hillbilly Elegy, a blend of scholarly, poetic and narrative rebuttals to Vance\u2019s tale published in 2019.\n\nHarkins, a professor of history at Western Kentucky University, said that Hillbilly Elegy loses its footing by generalizing one person\u2019s narrative into a definitive account of the entire region.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally legitimate for anybody to tell their own story and how they see it,\u201d Harkins told NPR. \u201cBut to then present it as the story of Appalachia, to speak of a memoir of a culture, is problematic particularly because that region has so often been stereotyped and misrepresented through recent history.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMcCarroll, author of Unwhite: Appalachia, Race, and Film and an Appalachian native of Waynesville, N.C., said that the duo\u2019s goal with the book was to spotlight a chorus of Appalachian voices in response to Elegy\u2019s immense popularity, both existing on their own and in opposition to the text.\n\n\u201cMy inclination was to gather a lot of different voices, both that are challenging him but not speaking to him at all,\u201d McCarroll told NPR. \u201cIt\u2019s this weaving together of a lot of different authentic perspectives that can give a sense of how layered and complex this 13 state region is.\u201d\n\nMcCarroll added that beyond Hillbilly Elegy, she wanted Appalachian Reckoning to counter the idea of Appalachia as a monolithic place.\n\n\u201cThe back half of the book moved beyond Hillbilly Elegy, and really is just a collection of narratives from the region that you can\u2019t read and come away thinking you understand Appalachia,\u201d McCarroll said. \u201cNo one should say, \u2018I read one book, and so I understand this region.\u2019\u201d\n\nWriting the full truth\n\nFor these writers, telling the honest story of Appalachia is tantamount\u2013even if they start difficult conversations.\n\nElizabeth Catte, historian and author of What You Are Getting Wrong About Appalachia, published in 2018, said that books about Appalachia fall short for her when authors lean on inauthentic stereotypes in pursuit of authenticity.\n\n\u201cSometimes people try to make up for personal knowledge or experience or study of a region by laying a bunch of tropes on a book and calling it authentic,\u201d Catte told NPR. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t get a sense that Appalachia has a history, that it\u2019s just a place full of problems, but none of those problems have an origin, or the origin is uninteresting to the author.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s story has resonated with conservatives and non-Appalachians alike. In the wake of the 2016 election, the book became an explanation of sorts for some liberals as to who Trump\u2019s supporters were and how he managed to win the presidency. One op-ed described Bostonians as \u201clapping up\u201d the tale.\n\ntoggle caption Jeffrey Dean/AP\n\nThe book became a best-seller and later was adapted into a movie. But for those from the region, crucial pieces of the puzzle that Vance painted are missing.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHarkins said that when discussing Appalachian history, texts must keep economic context in mind, like Appalachia\u2019s political and cultural history with coal, when thinking about how the past has turned into the present.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t speak about the experience of Appalachia in the last hundred years without thinking about the massive effects that economic change have brought to it, in a place that is often the product of extractive industry, whether it\u2019s lumbering or coal or fracking,\u201d Harkins said. \u201cOne of the concerns I have with seeing it through the prism of Hillbilly Elegy is often that most of that stuff is not part of the story.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s politics might not land with all readers, but he focused much of his Republican National Convention speech, which he gave just two days after being named to the ticket, on his relationship with his mom and grandma. These relationships are where these authors have found a common ground. For Kingsolver\u2019s fictional quest, it was similarly important to keep Demon\u2019s humanity front and center, both for the reader and for herself.\n\n\u201cI was kind of scared to write this novel for several years because you can\u2019t bludgeon people with sadness or with truths that are hard to bear,\u201d Kingsolver said. \u201cUnless you give it a really delicious package. You have to give people a reason to turn the page. You have to give people characters that they love and believe in, that they honestly start to care about as their friend.\u201d\n\nThe power of representation\n\nKingsolver said that when Demon Copperhead won the Pulitzer Prize last year, Appalachia rejoiced like Appalachia does.\n\n\u201cIt was like fireworks all up and down the mountain,\u201d Kingsolver said. \u201cSo many people from here, even my mail carrier and the cashier at the grocery store, said, \u2018This is amazing. We won.\u2019\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe novel has appealed to more than Appalachians: It unanimously won the 2023\u2019s Women Prize, and more recently, it ranked No. 1 on the New York Times\u2019 readers\u2019 \u201cBest Books of the Century\u201d list\u2013and No. 61 on the critics\u2019 list.\n\nMcCarroll said that with novels coming out today like Demon Copperhead, it is hard to stay upset at the negative aspects of Hillbilly Elegy.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so exciting is that there are so many really diverse, beautiful stories that are really offering complicated perspectives, and so it\u2019s like I don\u2019t feel like I have to stay mad at Hillbilly Elegy,\u201d McCarroll said. \u201cThere\u2019s a long history of Appalachian literature, too.\u201d\n\nMcCarroll added that a variety of stories is important because they add texture to a region too often boxed into one corner.\n\n\u201cWhat a Black Appalachian coal miner in Pennsylvania is experiencing might be very different from a Mexican migrant worker in Western North Carolina is experiencing, which might be really different than what a third- or fourth-generation farmer who is white in Kentucky is experiencing,\u201d McCarroll said.\n\nKingsolver said that when writing Demon Copperhead, it was important to combat assumptions made by mainstream media outlets about Appalachia.\n\n\u201cI think they miss our diversity. They think we\u2019re all white, and we\u2019re not. It was important for me to reflect that in this novel,\u201d Kingsolver said. \u201cI wanted it to be the great Appalachian novel that kind of puts our whole region in a context. We didn\u2019t choose to have poverty and [high] unemployment. We didn\u2019t ask for that. This came to us.\u201d\n\nKingsolver added that it has been especially gratifying hearing from people whose perspective on Appalachia changed after reading her novel.\n\n\u201cI have heard from lots and lots and lots of people in other parts of the country who said, \u2018This book asked me to evaluate my prejudices, and I thank you for that,\u2019 \u201d Kingsolver said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhen Kingsolver received news that she was at the top of the Times\u2019 readers\u2019 list last month, she said she had to \u201clie down on the floor\u201d and think about its weight. Kingsolver said that a less obvious reward, though, was readers celebrating a story of an imperfect, wholly Appalachian character.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how many people have written to tell me I\u2019m still worried about Demon, I wake up at night worrying about him,\u201d Kingsolver said. \u201cAs if he\u2019s become their kid. He\u2019s the world\u2019s kid. That\u2019s how you navigate it, that\u2019s how you have to.\u201d\n\nThough Hillbilly Elegy might loom large once again, Appalachian authors, whether through fictional tales like Demon Copperhead or nonfiction deep dives like What You Are Getting Wrong About Appalachia, are finding strength in their resistance and dissent.\n\nReacting to news of being on the New York Times' list, Kingsolver wrote in an Instagram post:\n\n\u201cWith a certain other \u2018hillbilly\u2019 book suddenly ascendant, my duty. No elegies here. Thank you.\u201d",
