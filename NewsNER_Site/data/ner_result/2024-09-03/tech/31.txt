Michel	O
Martin:	O
You've	O
participated	O
in	O
wreath-laying	O
ceremonies	O
at	O
Arlington,	O
and	O
I	O
understand	O
that	O
you've	O
conducted	O
services	O
there,	O
funerals	O
there.	O
Political	O
leaders	O
come	O
to	O
them	O
all	O
the	O
time.	O
How	O
do	O
you	O
keep	O
these	O
ceremonies	O
from	O
becoming	O
“political?”	O
David	O
Peters:	O
There's	O
always	O
a	O
tension	O
there.	O
Being	O
right	O
there	O
in	O
the	O
heart	O
of	O
Washington,	O
D.C.,	O
and	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
are	O
coming	O
there	O
to	O
honor	O
those	O
who	O
have	O
died.	O
But	O
also	O
the	O
staff	O
there,	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
there,	O
I	O
witnessed	O
a	O
very	O
professional	O
staff	O
that	O
worked	O
really	O
hard	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
flow	O
going	O
of	O
people	O
that	O
are	O
grieving	O
and	O
people	O
that	O
are	O
there	O
to	O
honor	O
the	O
dead,	O
but	O
also	O
to	O
to	O
really	O
show	O
that	O
these	O
young	O
people	O
are	O
special	O
for	O
our	O
country	O
and	O
are	O
symbols	O
of	O
hope	O
and	O
courage	O
for	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
us.	O
Martin:	O
Some	O
people	O
might	O
argue	O
you	O
can't	O
tell	O
people	O
how	O
to	O
grieve.	O
And	O
if	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
grieve	O
by	O
bringing,	O
you	O
know,	O
former	O
President	O
Trump,	O
whom	O
they	O
support,	O
to	O
criticize	O
the	O
current	O
leadership,	O
then	O
that's	O
their	O
business.	O
How	O
would	O
you	O
respond	O
to	O
that?	O
Peters:	O
Families	O
and	O
friends	O
that	O
grieve	O
loved	O
ones,	O
especially	O
young	O
people	O
that	O
have	O
died,	O
do	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
different	O
ways.	O
So,	O
I	O
don't	O
ever	O
tell	O
people	O
how	O
to	O
grieve	O
or	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
that.	O
But	O
certainly	O
in	O
the	O
sacred	O
ground	O
of	O
Arlington,	O
when	O
the	O
camera	O
comes	O
in,	O
it	O
makes	O
the	O
story	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
different	O
to	O
outsiders.	O
And	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
grief	O
that	O
is	O
expressed	O
there,	O
even	O
if	O
it's	O
sometimes	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
comical	O
or	O
joyful,	O
can	O
certainly	O
be	O
misinterpreted	O
when	O
it	O
gets	O
out	O
to	O
the	O
larger	O
community.	O
The	O
Trump	O
campaign	O
shared	O
photos	O
and	O
video	O
that	O
show	O
the	O
headstone	O
of	O
a	O
Green	O
Beret,	O
whose	O
family	O
did	O
not	O
give	O
permission	O
to	O
be	O
included.	O
Martin:	O
And	O
we've	O
learned	O
there	O
was	O
another	O
service	O
member	O
whose	O
family	O
members	O
did	O
not	O
appreciate	O
his	O
headstone	O
being	O
seen	O
in	O
this	O
video.	O
And	O
I	O
kind	O
of	O
wonder	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
balance	O
that?	O
You	O
have,	O
on	O
the	O
one	O
hand,	O
a	O
family	O
that	O
wants	O
Trump	O
there.	O
And	O
then	O
you've	O
got	O
other	O
family	O
members	O
there,	O
sharing	O
that	O
space,	O
who	O
don't	O
appreciate	O
that.	O
How	O
do	O
you	O
sort	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
out?	O
Peters:	O
It's	O
nearly	O
impossible	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
symbolic	O
nature	O
of	O
what	O
these	O
gravestones	O
and	O
the	O
bodies	O
that	O
are	O
buried	O
beneath	O
them	O
mean	O
to	O
us.	O
There's	O
always	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
tension	O
there	O
about	O
how	O
those	O
symbols	O
are	O
used.	O
And	O
that's	O
why	O
the	O
staff	O
at	O
Arlington,	O
as	O
I	O
got	O
to	O
experience	O
them,	O
are	O
very	O
careful	O
to	O
really	O
focus	O
on	O
what	O
we	O
are	O
here	O
to	O
do,	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
to	O

that	O
