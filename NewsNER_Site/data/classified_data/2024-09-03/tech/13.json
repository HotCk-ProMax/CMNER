Some of that is straightforward, but wheelchair navigation sometimes includes negotiating unexpected curbs, stairs, steep hills and other obstacles\u2014 and most wheelchair users don\u2019t have access to formal training to learn how to smoothly navigate on their own.\n\nA unique, free program called Skills on Wheels run by Indiana University Indianapolis aims to address the gap for young people. Around 20 kids ranging from age 8 to 17, spend multiple days on campus learning how to navigate props like ramps and speed bumps. Then they take those new skills for a test run outside.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSavannah Healton, 12, has spina bifida, a neural tube defect in the spine. She needs a wheelchair, and lately, she\u2019s been practicing how to do wheelies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically where you push two times, and then you pop into your wheelie,\u201d Healton said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re going up a curb, you can get into your wheelie so you can go up the hill or the curb or wherever you\u2019re going.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little research about the use of wheelchairs by children, but one study shows that 75% of adults who use a wheelchair have a fear of falling. Nearly 65% reported falling out of their chair, and more than half had incidents resulting in an injury. Even without accidents, improper technique can injure muscles and nerves.\n\nA child\u2019s confidence can take a big hit if they don\u2019t know how to maneuver their wheelchair or fear falling out of it, says program director and Indiana University occupational therapy researcher Tony Chase. Kids may decide to skip certain activities at school or with friends if they know there will be obstacles like narrow doors or stairs.\n\n\u201cWe would love to change the world, and just make it all of a sudden accessible, but that's a little bit too lofty of a goal,\u201d Chase said. \u201cSo instead, let's try to make kids more confident in navigating this inaccessible world.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nResearchers have developed a list of 33 core skills that are essential for navigating a wheelchair in a variety of environments, but kids might not learn these skills in school or in physical and occupational therapy.\n\nMaria Fuchs, an occupational therapist volunteering with the program, said she didn\u2019t learn much about hands-on wheelchair training during grad school.\n\n\u201cA lot of times wheelchair training isn\u2019t a main focus\u2026other things like feeding or dressing or play skills, things like that, are kind of the priority,\u201d Fuchs said.\n\ntoggle caption Elizabeth Gabriel/Side Effects Public Media\n\nKids often learn only the basics of wheelchair operation, she said, like using the wheel locks and taking the device apart, and even then only if insurance covers it.\n\nKerri Morgan, an occupational therapy and neurology researcher at Washington University in St. Louis, said some people\u2019s insurance won\u2019t reimburse them for rehab to learn how to use a wheelchair.\n\n\u201cThere's this gap in education, [and] there's the gap in actually having the environment in the medical model where clinicians know how to justify it in their notes, so that health insurance pays for it,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nMorgan said it\u2019s common for wheelchair users to learn new skills through other people with disabilities or watching online videos. But that isn\u2019t always safe if someone isn\u2019t advanced enough to try a new skill, if their wheelchair is set up differently, or if they don't have someone behind them to catch a fall.\n\ntoggle caption Elizabeth Gabriel/Side Effects Public Media\n\nEven with a spotter, practicing some skills can be dangerous. Large wheelchairs can weigh between 15 and 50 pounds, not including the weight of the person inside it.\n\nThat\u2019s why Savannah\u2019s mom, Chanda Healton, holds onto a strap that connects to the back of her daughter\u2019s wheelchair so it\u2019s safe for Savannah to practice wheelies.\n\nThe program isn\u2019t just helpful for Savannah, it allows her mom to learn proper techniques in case the wheelchair starts to tip backward. Healton says she plans to bring her daughter back again next year.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Healton said. \u201cFirst time I watched her I had tears in my eyes. I\u2019m like oh my gosh, that\u2019s my baby girl.\"\n\nSide Effects Public Media is a health reporting collaboration between NPR and public radio stations in Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, Ohio and Kentucky.\n\n",
