When	O
you	O
get	O
married,	O
there	O
are	O
so	O
many	O
details	O
to	O
figure	O
out.	O
The	O

whether	O
you're	O
changing	O
your	O

how	O
to	O

your	O

Amid	O
these	O
decisions,	O
Theresa	O
Viera,	O
a	O
family	O
law	O
attorney	O
based	O
in	O
North	O
Carolina,	O
would	O
like	O
you	O
to	O
spare	O
a	O
moment	O
to	O
consider	O
a	O
prenuptial	O
agreement.	O
It's	O
a	O
legal	O
contract	O
between	O
soon-to-be	O
spouses	O
that	O
lays	O
out	O
how	O
couples	O
will	O
deal	O
with	O
money	O
during	O
a	O
marriage	O
and,	O
if	O
it	O
happens,	O
after	O
a	O
divorce.	O
That	O
includes	O
assets,	O
debts	O
and	O
spousal	O
support.	O

Message	O
And	O
they're	O
not	O
just	O
for	O
celebrities	O
and	O
wealthy	O
people	O
with	O
loads	O
of	O
property	O
and	O
investment	O
accounts,	O
says	O
Viera.	O
They're	O
for	O
everybody.	O
In	O
2023,	O
Axios	O
and	O
the	O
market	O
research	O
firm	O
Harris	O
Poll	O
found	O
that	O
over	O
50%	O
of	O
U.S.	O
adults	O
polled	O
said	O
they	O
were	O
open	O
to	O
signing	O
a	O
prenup.	O
Here's	O
what	O
to	O
know	O
about	O
these	O
contracts	O
—	O
and	O
how	O
to	O
decide	O
whether	O
to	O
get	O
one.	O
Talk	O
about	O
a	O
prenup	O
at	O
least	O
6	O
months	O
before	O
the	O
wedding	O
"It	O
should	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
discussions	O
after	O
the	O
engagement	O
ring	O
is	O
exchanged,"	O
says	O
Viera.	O
"You	O
don't	O
want	O
the	O
duress	O
of	O
a	O
wedding	O
to	O
influence	O
your	O
decision	O
to	O
enter	O
into	O
a	O
prenup."	O
While	O
few	O
people	O
want	O
to	O
bring	O
up	O
divorce	O
on	O
the	O
verge	O
of	O
getting	O
married,	O
couples	O
should	O
think	O
of	O
prenups	O
like	O
insurance,	O
says	O
Viera.	O
They're	O
a	O
financial	O
safety	O
net.	O
"We're	O
not	O
preconceiving	O
that	O
a	O
divorce	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
occur.	O
We're	O
discussing	O
important	O
financial	O
issues	O
that	O
come	O
up	O
in	O
every	O
marriage."	O
Ask	O
yourselves:	O
What	O
are	O
your	O
big	O
financial	O
goals	O
for	O
the	O
future?	O
Do	O
you	O
want	O
a	O
shared	O
bank	O
account?	O
Do	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
own	O
a	O
business	O
someday?	O
Do	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
pay	O
off	O
your	O
student	O

together?	O
At	O
what	O

of	O

Message	O
Your	O
answers	O
may	O
determine	O
what	O
to	O
include	O
in	O
your	O
prenup	O
—	O
and	O
whether	O
it's	O
right	O
for	O
you.	O
Know	O
what	O
happens	O
if	O
you	O
don't	O
get	O
a	O
prenup	O
"If	O
you	O
get	O
married	O
and	O
you	O
don't	O
have	O
an	O
agreement	O
stating	O
how	O
your	O
finances,	O
your	O
property	O
and	O
your	O
debts	O
are	O
organized	O
during	O
the	O
marriage,	O
then	O
the	O
state	O
laws	O
would	O
apply,"	O
says	O
Viera.	O
Every	O
state	O
law	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
different	O
—	O
but	O
prenups	O
basically	O
allow	O
couples	O
to	O
decide	O
how	O
to	O
manage	O
their	O
financial	O
affairs	O
during	O
and	O
after	O
a	O
marriage.	O
If	O
you	O
decide	O
that	O
a	O
prenuptial	O
agreement	O
isn't	O
for	O
you,	O
Viera	O
tells	O
soon-t0-be	O
spouses	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
tough	O
conversation	O
about	O
their	O
finances	O
anyway.	O
Otherwise,	O
she	O
adds,	O
couples	O
miss	O
out	O
on	O
creating	O
a	O
strong	O
foundation	O
for	O
their	O
marriage.	O
"I've	O
had	O
clients	O
say,	O
'Hey	O
Theresa,	O
we're	O
OK	O
with	O
how	O
the	O
state	O
laws	O
apply	O
to	O
our	O
situation	O
should	O
we	O
get	O
divorced.	O
We	O
don't	O
need	O
a	O
prenup.'	O
And	O
my	O
response	O
is,	O
'Good.	O
I'm	O
glad	O
you	O
had	O
the	O
discussion.'	O
"	O
Get	O
a	O
lawyer	O
Each	O
spouse	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
lawyer	O
when	O
negotiating	O
a	O
prenup,	O
says	O
Viera.	O
Your	O
legal	O
rights	O
change	O
when	O
you	O
marry,	O
including	O
your	O
tax	O
and	O
estate	O
rights.	O
Prenups	O
are	O
legally	O
binding	O
contracts,	O
she	O

"So	O
you	O

what	O
your	O
legal	O
rights	O
are	O
first	O
and	O
have	O
a	O
clear	O

that."	O
Remember:	O
When	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
kids,	O
prenups	O
can't	O
include	O
details	O
about	O
child	O
support.	O
But	O
they	O
can	O
protect	O
a	O

in	O
the	O
