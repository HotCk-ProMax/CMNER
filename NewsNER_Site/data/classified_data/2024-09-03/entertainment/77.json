The band was selected as the winner out of nearly 7,000 submissions from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.\n\nWatch the winning entry, a performance of \"What's It All Mean,\" on NPR.org/music.\n\nThe band's eclectic, soul-fueled performance captivated this year's Tiny Desk Contest judging panel, which included: Tiny Desk host and series producer Bobby Carter; host of All Songs Considered Robin Hilton; musician and producer Bobby Wooten; KEXP host Stas THEE Boss; Indonesian pop star NIKI; singer and actor Durand Bernarr; pop band MUNA; songwriter and guitarist in boygenius Julien Baker; president of Beggars Group U.S. Nabil Ayers; jazz podcast host Keanna Faircloth; WBUR music critic Amelia Mason; KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic host Novena Carmel; former Tiny Desk Contest winner NEFFY; music manager at Ten Atoms Brendan O'Connell; and owner of Guerrera Marketing & PR Loren Medina.\n\n\"The Philharmonik's Tiny Desk contest submission was just perfect,\" said Bobby Carter. \"The concept and the dedication from start to finish was so heartwarming. But if Christian and the band sat in front of a black backdrop and played \"What's It All Mean?,\" they still win. It's a song and a message we all can connect to and more importantly, they brought something fresh to this year's Contest. The Philharmonik is SPECIAL.\"\n\n\"To win NPR's 2024 Tiny Desk Contest was the best thing that happened to me in my entire career and one of the best moments of my life thus far,\" said The Philharmonik's Christian Gates. \"Just for the simple fact that it provides enough evidence for me to keep going and always do my best when making and sharing my art with the world!\"\n\nThis is The Philharmonik's second time participating in the Tiny Desk Contest. They submitted a video in 2019 called \"Good Day.\"\n\nTune in to NPR's All Things Considered this afternoon for the first interview with the 2024 Contest winner.
