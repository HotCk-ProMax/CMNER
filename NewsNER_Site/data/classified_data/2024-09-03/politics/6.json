He can keep on putting more and more obstacles and demands, but that's not relevant,\" Tel Aviv resident Ori Elman told NPR.\n\nOver the weekend, Netanyahu said he would not give up Israeli military control of a strip of land between Egypt and Gaza called the Philadelphi corridor as part of any negotiating framework.\n\nHe's insisted it\u2019s vital to his government's stated goal of eliminating Hamas and the militant group\u2019s access to smuggling tunnels there, but this has become a major sticking point with Hamas and mediators including the U.S., Qatar and Egypt.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in the past few weeks as ceasefire talks continue.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAmong the bodies recovered from Gaza was 23-year-old Israeli American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who had become widely known due to his family\u2019s efforts to secure his release, including an appearance at last month\u2019s Democratic National Convention.\n\nGoldberg-Polin\u2019s family responded to the news with a statement released Sunday.\n\n\u201cWith broken hearts, the Goldberg-Polin family is devastated to announce the death of their beloved son and brother, Hersh. The family thanks you all for your love and support and asks for privacy at this time,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had located and recovered the six bodies from \u201can underground tunnel in the Rafah area in the Gaza Strip and returned them to Israeli territory.\u201d\n\nIsrael's Health Ministry said the \"six abductees were murdered by Hamas terrorists in a number of short-range shots,\" and that forensic examination indicated that they had been killed in the last few days.\n\nMany protesters insisted a cease-fire deal could have saved their lives.\n\n\"Time after time there's a chance to bring them home, and he finds other reasons for it not to happen, so we just have to do something,\" said Ronit Katzenstein-Nahmias, in reference to Netanyahu.\n\nIn a statement from the official forum representing hostage families, the remaining five hostages were identified as Carmel Gat, 40; Eden Yerushalmi, 24; Alexander Lobanov, 32; Almog Sarusi, 27; and Ori Danino, 25.\n\nThey are some of the youngest hostages that were kidnapped on Oct. 7 by Hamas militants. Five of them were taken from a music festival that day at the Israel-Gaza border. The sixth was taken from a nearby border farm.\n\nPresident Biden issued a statement late Saturday saying he was \u201cdevastated and outraged.\u201d\n\nGoldberg-Polin\u2019s parents, Rachel Goldberg and Jon Polin, had made an appearance at the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 21 to apply pressure to help bring hostages abducted by militants back home. They had met with world leaders, including the pope.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBiden\u2019s statement said Goldberg-Polin\u2019s parents \u201chave been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is as tragic as it is reprehensible. Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages,\u201d Biden\u2019s statement continued.\n\nGoldberg-Polin, a native of Berkeley, Calif., was abducted at the music festival during the Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. About 250 hostages were taken by Hamas and other attackers that day.\n\nThe Israeli government estimates there are over 100 hostages still being held in Gaza, with about one-third of them believed to be dead.\n\nRelatives and supporters of the hostages continue to say Netanyahu has not done enough to make a deal with Hamas to secure their release.\n\nNegotiations have stalled for months, with Netanyahu repeatedly insisting military pressure is the best strategy despite public disagreement with his top security officials.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military offensive in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks has killed at least 40,786 people and injured more than 94,224, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.\n\nIn a video statement Sunday, Netanyahu said Israel has been \"holding intensive negotiations with the mediator\" in recent days to reach a deal but said Hamas had refused all proposals.\n\n\"Whoever murders hostages \u2014 does not want a deal,\" he said. \"For our part, we will not relent. The government of Israel is committed, and I am personally committed, to continue striving toward a deal that will return all of our hostages and ensure our security and our existence.\"\n\nHamas says that Israel is to blame for the stalemate and that it has repeatedly added new demands to deals already agreed upon.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe head of Israel\u2019s National Unity Party blamed Netanyahu, posting on social media: \"He should protect the abductees and not his coalition controlled by extremists.\"",
