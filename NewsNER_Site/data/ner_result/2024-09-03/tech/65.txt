aims	O
to	O
answer	O
this	O
crucial	O
question	O
as	O
climate	O
change,	O
increased	O
visitation,	O
and	O
new	O

are	O
testing	O
the	O

How	O

listeners	O
will	O
visit	O
public	O
lands	O
in	O
the	O
American	B-LOC
West	O
to	O
explore	O
the	O
concept	O
of	O
wilderness,	O
how	O
it's	O
changing,	O
and	O
how	O
the	O
stories	O
we	O
tell	O
about	O
wilderness	O
say	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
about	O
us	O
than	O
the	O
land.	O
“As	O
a	O
long-time	O
backpacker	O
and	O
former	O
naturalist	O
in	O
National	O
Parks	O
and	O
Forests,	O
I’ve	O
noticed	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
changes	O
over	O
the	O
years,”	O
says	O
Ortega-Welch.	O
“More	O
wildfires,	O
trails	O
becoming	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
crowded,	O
and	O
people	O
using	O
their	O
phones	O
to	O
navigate	O
instead	O
of	O
a	O
paper	O

I’m	O
fascinated	O
by	O
how	O
these	O
changes	O
are	O
testing	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
wilderness,	O
in	O
both	O
good	O
and	O
bad	O
ways.	O
How	O
do	O
we	O
think	O
about	O
what	O
is	O
‘natural’	O
in	O
the	O
era	O
of	O
climate	O
change?	O
How	O
do	O
we	O
think	O
about	O
these	O
areas	O
as	O
being	O
places	O
where	O
humans	O
are	O
just	O
‘visitors’	O
while	O
also	O
recognizing	O
the	O
long	O
history	O
of	O
management	O
of	O
these	O
lands	O
by	O
Indigenous	O
peoples?”	O

to	O

A	O
hundred	O
years	O
ago,	O
the	O
U.S.	O
Forest	O
Service	O
set	O
aside	O
the	O
first	O
official	O
wilderness	O
in	O
the	O
world:	O
the	O
Gila	O
Wilderness	O
in	O
New	O
Mexico.	O
Forty	O
years	O
later,	O
the	O
1964	O
Wilderness	O
Act	O
defined	O
wilderness	O
as	O
“an	O
area	O
where	O
the	O
earth	O
and	O
its	O
community	O
of	O
life	O
are	O
untrammeled	O
