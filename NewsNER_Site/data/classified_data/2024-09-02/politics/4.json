The outcome of yesterday\u2019s elections has political observers worried about a resurgence of anti-immigrant, populist politics in Germany and Europe.\n\nHere are five takeaways from yesterday\u2019s elections:\n\n\n\n1. The nationalist, anti-immigrant politics of the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland Party (AfD) are becoming more popular in Germany.\n\nThe AfD, a nationalist party that routinely blames immigrants for many of Germany\u2019s problems, has been around for 11 years and it rose in prominence six years ago after former Chancellor Angela Merkel allowed more than a million migrants from war-torn countries in the Middle East to resettle in Germany.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe AfD has become so notorious that it\u2019s been placed under domestic surveillance for the threat that it poses to Germany\u2019s constitution. Despite this, the party won the most seats in the election in Th\u00fcringen with nearly a third of parliament (32.8%), and it nearly won the most seats in Saxony, with more than 30% of the vote.\n\n\n\n2. Unchecked migration in Germany is becoming one of voters\u2019 biggest concerns.\n\nGerman voters are becoming increasingly frustrated by a wave of migrants arriving in the country in recent years, especially now that Germany\u2019s economy has stagnated.\n\nThis frustration peaked last week when a Syrian man stabbed to death three people and injured several others at a festival in the western German city of Solingen.\n\nAfter the attack, it was discovered that the man was supposed to have been deported months ago, and it led to growing anger about Germany\u2019s immigration system.\n\n\n\n3. Despite the party\u2019s big gains in these two state elections, the AfD will likely be kept from participating in the government of either state.\n\nThat\u2019s because every other party in Germany has refused to enter into a coalition government with the AfD.\n\ntoggle caption Markus Schreiber/AP\n\nStill, the nationalist, Russia-friendly party could end up with enough seats in both states to block decisions requiring a two-thirds vote, such as the appointment of judges and top security officials.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n4. A party on the opposite end of the political spectrum from the AfD but with similar populist politics, the left-wing BSW Party, has also made a big splash in both states.\n\nThe Sahra Wageknecht Alliance (BSW), a party centered on a popular former communist party politician, won more than 15% of seats in Th\u00fcringen and more than 11% of seats in Saxony\u2019s parliament, just eight months after the party was founded.\n\nLike the AfD, the leftist party also advocates tightening immigration into Germany and is against Germany\u2019s support for Ukraine, wanting a diplomatic solution to the war. The BSW\u2019s strong showing is bad news for Germany\u2019s social democrats, the party of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, which could see more left-leaning voters drawn away from the party.\n\n\n\n5. What today\u2019s election results may mean for next year\u2019s federal election in Germany\n\nPerhaps most interesting is that the three parties in power on a national level \u2014 the social democrats (SPD), the Green Party, and the libertarian FDP party\u2014 all suffered big losses in these state elections, and it underscores how unpopular they\u2019ve become with voters not only in the former East, but nationally as well.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that in the next national election, the country is going to make a shift to the right. That will mean stricter immigration rules and a bigger focus on growing Germany\u2019s stagnant economy. This is a trend we\u2019re seeing in other parts of Europe, too, namely France, where a strong showing by a right-wing party there has yet to produce a new government.",
