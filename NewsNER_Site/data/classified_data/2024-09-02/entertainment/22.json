    "text": "In 'Miss Merkel,' Germany's former chancellor is a crime-solving amateur detective\n\ntoggle caption RTL/Maor Waisburd\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Little is known about how Germany\u2019s former Chancellor Angela Merkel is spending her retirement, and that seems to be the way she likes it. Thanks to a German crime fiction series adapted for television and now proving a hit in Italy, she is back in the headlines \u2014 this time as a fictional small-town amateur sleuth.\n\nAs the title suggests, Miss Merkel is a whodunnit that imagines the former chancellor as an Agatha Christie-style detective who starts solving crimes out of sheer boredom. For want of a G7 or European Union summit, Merkel is desperate to put down the garden shears and get back to solving something, anything! This time, it\u2019s a village murder. Move over, Miss Marple!\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe TV adaptation stars German theater doyenne Katharina Thalbach as Merkel. Like Merkel, Thalbach is 70 and from former East Germany. She says it wasn\u2019t too hard to prepare for the role.\n\n\u201cYou could always see the burden of power in Merkel\u2019s shoulders, how it weighed on her,\u201d Thalbach tells NPR. \u201cSo, I focused on my shoulders, put on a wig and one of her signature colorful boxy blazers and I had the feeling I was her. That I am Angela Merkel!\u201d\n\ntoggle caption RTL/Maor Waisburd\n\nThalbach has met Merkel a number of times but is not sure whether the ex-chancellor is a fan of Miss Merkel.\n\n\u201cThe last time I saw Angela, I tried to find out whether she\u2019s read the books or seen the series,\u201d Thalbach recalls. \u201cBut she deftly dodged the question, saying instead that her office staff are big fans.\u201d\n\nThe books\u2019 author , David Safier, known previously for his fictional accounts of the Holocaust and his work as a scriptwriter , says he\u2019s also none the wiser as to what Merkel thinks of his alternative retirement plan for her.\n\ntoggle caption Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\n\u201cProbably she has read the novels,\u201d Safier speculates. \u201cTo be honest, if there would be a crime novel where you are the hero, wouldn\u2019t you at least read the first 10 pages?\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhile the books are a commercial success, the small-screen adaptation by RTL \u2014 which will be available to stream later this year in the U.S. \u2014 has received lukewarm reviews in Germany. The broadsheet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung acknowledged the star power that Thalbach\u2019s performance brings to the production, but lamented the show\u2019s \u201ccorny jokes.\u201d German magazine Fokus suggested the production company engage Safier as the scriptwriter, seeing as he won an Emmy for a German sitcom Berlin, Berlin .\n\nSafier came up with the idea for Miss Merkel in 2019, on the day Merkel announced she wouldn\u2019t be running for a fifth term. He says he sat down to watch an old rerun of Columbo that same evening and the idea for his top-10 Spiegel bestseller was born.\n\nSafier says Angela Merkel makes for a consummate detective.\n\n\u201cMerkel is highly intelligent, much more intelligent than other politicians,\u201d he says. \u201cShe is strongheaded. And, after 30 years in politics, she\u2019s used to dealing with sociopaths and psychopaths.\u201d\n\nLike Miss Marple, Merkel is often underestimated \u2014 something the former chancellor used to her advantage throughout her political career. Thalbach says this particularly baffled alpha-male politicians.\n\ntoggle caption RTL/Maor Waisburd\n\n\u201cThe real Merkel was brilliant at finding skeletons in the closets of her political rivals,\u201d Thalbach asserts. \u201cBut she had none of her own: the perfect trait for an ace detective!\u201d\n\nSafier says it\u2019s the references to Merkel\u2019s former life as chancellor that tickle his readers.\n\nIn the first book, Miss Merkel attends a community theater production and remarks that \u201ccompared to six hours of Beijing Opera with Xi Jinping, everything else is a piece of cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer experience helps her to solve crime mysteries. When she\u2019s questioning a suspect, she knows that she has to wear him down,\u201d Safier says of his main character. \u201cMerkel knows what it\u2019s like to probe and ask questions over and over again. She did it until the early hours at countless EU summits.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nUnlike Miss Marple, Merkel is actually a Mrs. \u2014 a Frau Dr., that is, with a Ph.D. in quantum chemistry. In the TV series, Merkel\u2019s husband asks why she\u2019s still wearing her trademark pantsuits in retirement. Her answer could be considered classic Merkel logic: \u201cI\u2019ve still got 50 of them in my wardrobe.\u201d\n\nAngie nostalgia aside, Safier says that in his next book , Miss Merkel is seeing a therapist after realizing, while writing her memoirs, that she neglected to solve a number of issues during her time in office \u2014 be it Germany\u2019s ailing railway system or relations with Russia.",
