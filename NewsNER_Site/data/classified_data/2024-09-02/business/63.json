    "text": "A lithium mine in Serbia could rev up Europe's e-vehicles, but opposition is fierce\n\ntoggle caption Darko Vojinovic/AP\n\nJADAR VALLEY, Serbia \u2014 Vladan Jakovljevic\u2019s bees are angry. As he slowly lifts a cover from atop one of dozens of hives, they swarm, one of them stinging him in the cheek. He calls it a \u201cbee kiss.\u201d\n\nThe 63-year-old beekeeper\u2019s hives are scattered along a hillside overlooking the Jadar Valley\u2019s bucolic green hills and red clay tile-roofed villages of western Serbia. Bees, he points out, are sensitive creatures. Changes in the environment can wipe out their hives. That\u2019s why Jakovljevic is worried about plans to build one of Europe\u2019s largest lithium mines in this valley.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cIf there is any pollution in the river from this mine, bees in this region will die because they drink the water,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about 10,000 bee communities that pollinate the crops that grow in the valley. This could cause a devastating chain reaction.\u201d\n\nThe transition to a lower carbon emissions future depends on electric vehicles, and the batteries in those vehicles depend on lithium \u2014 a mineral in short supply and in big demand. But mining and refining lithium can have a big impact on local environments, and the residents of Jadar Valley have fought to protect theirs, spurring a national protest movement that has shed light on the environmental underbelly of the electric vehicle (EV) industry.\n\nIn the valley below Jakovljevic\u2019s beehives lies the village of Latina, \u201csalty\u201d in English. Hundreds of feet below the surface of the Jadar Valley lie salty mineral deposits that give the drinking water here a distinctive taste.\n\nDecades ago, scientists here discovered a new mineral they named jadarite, one rich in lithium and boron. After the Balkan wars of the 1990s, British Australian mining company Rio Tinto began drilling exploratory wells in Jadar Valley, confirming that it has one of Europe\u2019s largest deposits of lithium. It's so big it could meet an estimated 90% of Europe's lithium needs. It could be a boon for a continent focused on transitioning to electric vehicles to cut emissions, and for mining giant Rio Tinto, guaranteed profits.\n\nScientists warn of potential environmental problems\n\nThe company recently drilled more exploratory wells, but the water that surfaced from deep below the earth has killed surrounding crops and polluted the river, according to a study published last month in the journal Scientific Reports. Scientists found \u201csubstantially elevated concentrations of boron, arsenic, and lithium downstream from the wells.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the opening of the mine,\u201d the scientists wrote, \u201cproblems will be multiplied by the tailings pond, mine wastewater, noise, air pollution, and light pollution, endangering the lives of numerous local communities and destroying their freshwater sources, agricultural land, livestock, and assets.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Darko Vojinovic/AP\n\nBeekeeper Jakovljevic says he was shocked when he read the article.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cAfter I read the findings of those scientists, I didn\u2019t need to hear more about this project,\u201d he says. \u201cThis mine must be stopped.\u201d\n\n\n\nOfficials say it will meet strict standards and boost GDP\n\nBut officials in Serbia's government say the mine holds great potential for the country. \u201cWe are all drinking the same water and we all breathe the same air, and we all have kids living here,\u201d says Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic, Serbia\u2019s mining and energy minister. \u201cSo we want the project implemented, yes, but we want it implemented according to environmental standards.\u201d\n\nDjedovic Handanovic insists the proposed mine would adhere to strict European Union environmental standards, even though Serbia has not yet become an EU member.\n\ntoggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nAnd she highlights the mine\u2019s economic benefits. \u201cAround 20,000 people could be employed in the whole value chain,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when we are talking about value chain, we are not only talking the exploitation of the mine but actually refining processes, including the production of cathodes, production of batteries and ultimately the production of electric vehicles.\u201d\n\nShe says this lithium mine has the potential to increase Serbia\u2019s gross domestic product by 16%.\n\n\n\nProtests against the mine are becoming routine\n\nBut many Serbs remain unpersuaded. Massive protests against the project have become routine in cities throughout the country since June, when a court decision cleared the path for the government to approve the mine. The decision came two years after a previous prime minister revoked Rio Tinto\u2019s license following similar protests.\n\nJelena Isevski was one of tens of thousands who recently filled the streets of the capital of Belgrade to protest the mine.\n\n\u201cWe are here to say that we are saying no to corporate powers that extract our country, just dig it out and leave trash, literally trash, for future generations,\u201d she said over the chants of protesters.\n\ntoggle caption Vladimir Zivojinovic/AFP via Getty Images\n\nCritics of the mine like Isevski also question the political motivations of the Serbian government. Serbia has applied for EU membership, and the EU\u2019s largest economy, Germany \u2014 home to the continent's largest electric vehicle companies \u2014 has voiced its strong support for this mine. For years, Europe\u2019s wealthiest economies have wanted to shift away from depending on China, which refines 80% of the world\u2019s lithium for EV batteries. Just a few weeks after a legal path had been cleared for the Jadar mine, the European Union signed a memorandum of understanding with Serbia\u2019s government, launching what it called a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d on sustainable raw materials like lithium as well as battery value chains, and electric vehicles.\n\nIsevski says the EU should look within its 27-country bloc for its lithium. \u201cIt\u2019s not only Serbia that has lithium,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy is this being done in a country like Serbia, that allegedly doesn\u2019t have the right to fight back? There\u2019s lithium in France, right?\u201d\n\nOpponents of the mine also question the track record of mining giant Rio Tinto, which has a checkered history in developing countries throughout the world, including a mine in Papua New Guinea whose environmental destruction spurred a nine-year civil war.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRio Tinto commits to \"transparency\" and independent reviews\n\nBut Rio Tinto\u2019s manager of its Serbia operations, Chad Blewitt, says times have changed. \u201cWe are committed to transparency,\u201d he says. \u201cWe've learnt from all those incidents, including where there was a civil war in Papua New Guinea 35 years ago. That created a lot of our local content programs globally because we have to give back to the community.\u201d\n\nBlewitt\u2019s own history at Rio Tinto includes working as a manager at the company\u2019s Simandou iron ore mine in Guinea in 2011, the same year that company officials were found by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigators to have bribed a Guinean political adviser. Last year, Rio Tinto settled with the SEC for $15 million over the violations.\n\nBlewitt says in the case of the Jadar mine, Rio Tinto would be willing to allow independent experts to complete an environmental review of the project if it would help persuade those who question its impact on the ecosystem. As it stands, Blewitt calls Jadar \u201cthe most studied lithium project in Europe,\u201d saying Rio Tinto has spent more than $600 million on it so far and says the studies found it would be safe.\n\nPart of the company\u2019s effort is outreach \u2014 Blewitt says Rio Tinto has held 150 information sessions for the local community and Serbia\u2019s mining ministry has set up a call center to try to calm fears about the project, and about his company. \u201cLast year we spent $85 million on community programs globally,\u201d says Blewitt. \u201cWe gave back to governments around the world eight and a half billion US dollars in taxes. So I would say don't judge Rio Tinto by what we are in the past.\u201d\n\nBack in the Jadar Valley, beekeeper Jakovljevic says if he and his neighbors can\u2019t judge Rio Tinto by its past, then how, he asks, should they judge the company?\n\ntoggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nHe\u2019s joined by a neighbor, a literature teacher named Marijana Petkovic, and her dog for cool drinks in the shade on a hot summer\u2019s day. Petkovic points to homes across the field behind her property where some neighbors have sold their land to Rio Tinto. Dozens of homes in the valley are cordoned off with tape and are being demolished to make way for the project.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPetkovic has been following this issue closely. She says she thinks that Rio Tinto still needs hundreds more acres of land to build the mine but that the rest of the valley\u2019s residents are not willing to sell. \u201cThey\u2019re going house to house asking our neighbors if they need anything or if Rio Tinto can help them in any way,\u201d she says.\n\nThe employees work in an information center the company established in the valley, but Petkovic calls it a \u201cdisinformation\u201d center. She says the Serbian government has already tried to change the law so it can expropriate land from homeowners, but protests a few years ago put a stop to it.\n\nBut she says the local government recently rezoned her and her neighbor\u2019s land from \u201cagricultural\u201d to \u201cconstruction,\u201d which has her wondering if the government is about to try to take her land again. She says this makes her worry about the future of this valley, and for Serbia.",
