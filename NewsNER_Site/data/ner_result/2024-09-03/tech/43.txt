Alsaleem.	B-PER
In	O
some	O
relationships,	O
flirting	O
is	O
considered	O
cheating.	O
In	O
others,	O
it’s	O
no	O
big	O
deal.	O
So	O
explicitly	O
define	O
the	O
boundaries	O
of	O
your	O
relationship	O
as	O
early	O
as	O
possible.	O
Couples	O
assume	O
they’re	O
on	O
the	O

page	O
about	O
emotional	O
or	O

Cheating	O
means	O
your	O

is	O
over	O
Not	O
everyone	O
can	O
or	O
should	O

it’s	O

to	O

a	O
relationship	O
to	O
save	O
yourself	O
from	O

However,	O
in	O
Alsaleem’s	O
experience,	O
couples	O
can	O

do	O
recover	O
from	O
romantic	O
affairs	O

commit	O
