She says there's a lot to learn from bats\n\ntoggle caption Luis Echeverr\u00eda for NPR\n\nOn a dark night in northern Belize in early May, Gliselle Marin stands in the middle of a patchy forest in the Lamanai Archaeological Reserve, about a two-hour drive from where she grew up.\n\nEvery few minutes, she and her fellow researchers sweep their headlamps over the nets they\u2019ve strung up to see if they\u2019ve caught anything. Before long, a chirping leaf-nosed bat the color of hot cocoa is entangled. He\u2019s small \u2014 about the size of a lemon. Marin works carefully and quickly to free him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get the net off of him,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a puzzle. I like to take the feet out first. And then I do one wing, then the head.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWithin a minute, the tiny bat is out. Marin jots down some basic information about the bat and then places him inside a cloth bag for further study that night.\n\nAll the tools Marin needs for this kind of delicate extraction \u2014 including an ordinary crochet hook, for the worst tangles \u2014 fit into a fanny pack that\u2019s adorned with little printed bats. The scientist also sports bat earrings, as well as a tattoo of small bats flying up the nape of her neck.\n\nMarin is a biology PhD student at York University in Toronto, and she\u2019s here with the \u201cBat-a-thon,\u201d a group of 80-some bat researchers who converge on this part of Belize each year to study these winged mammals.\n\ntoggle caption Luis Echeverr\u00eda for NPR\n\nGrowing up, Marin\u2019s family had bats roosting under their house. \u201cBut when I actually started working with them and realizing we have close to 80 species of bats,\u201d she says, \u201cI was like, \u2018Okay, it\u2019s kind of crazy that I\u2019ve been in science my whole life and was never taught that we have this diversity of bats in Belize.\u2019\u201d\n\nOver time, she\u2019s come to admire not just the cornucopia of species, but the spectacular array of abilities and behaviors of these adaptable little animals. Scientists, she says, have only scratched the surface when it comes to understanding these furry, flying mammals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now at the point,\u201d she says, \u201cwhere I could hear something that sounds completely absurd and I wouldn\u2019t even question it, \u2018cause bats are just that unique. I\u2019d be like, \u2018Yep, that makes sense. I\u2019m sure they could do that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThinking about bats, outside the box\n\nScientists generally divide bats into three types: nectar feeders, fruit eaters, and insect eaters. They all play key roles in keeping forests like this one healthy \u2014 by pollinating plants, dispersing seeds, and devouring insects. That\u2019s why Marin, who is studying many different species of bats here in Belize, is particularly interested in studying bat poop.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to extract the DNA from the feces,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that will tell me every single thing that they\u2019ve been eating.\u201d\n\nMarin suspects bats may actually be more flexible with their diets than we tend to give them credit for. \u201cSo not just specializing in nectar,\u201d she says by way of example, \u201cbut consuming nectar and insects, or whatever shows up.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Luis Echeverr\u00eda for NPR\n\nMarin wants to know if bats routinely diversify their diet, or if they\u2019re being triggered to do so as their habitat is increasingly mowed down in the name of agriculture and human development.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this huge community of bats in an area that\u2019s becoming increasingly fragmented,\u201d she says. \u201cSo would they prefer to alter their diet within where they are, rather than fly really long flights to get to another place that has their resources?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a research question that Marin says could lead scientists more broadly to rethink their approach when it comes to studying and conserving not just bats, but mammals in general.\n\n\u201cScientists love to put things in categories,\u201d says Elizabeth Clare, a molecular ecologist at York University in Toronto and Marin\u2019s PhD advisor. \u201cA lot of the work that I\u2019ve done has been demonstrating that these are very artificial groups.\u201d\n\nMore and more, she says, \u201cwe\u2019re recognizing these are not accidents. [Bats] are flexible. And flexibility is really important in understanding who can survive and who can\u2019t.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Luis Echeverr\u00eda for NPR\n\nMarin says there are big conservation implications. As humans continue to raze their natural habitats, and climate change alters their ecosystems, just how susceptible are bats to these changes? And if the bats are switching their diets due to habitat degradation, is that flexibility helping them weather these challenges, or leaving them even more vulnerable than before?\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nProtecting Belize\u2019s natural legacy\n\nThe bat researchers working the nets alongside Marin during the Bat-a-thon are from all over the world, but she\u2019s the only one from Belize. In fact, she thinks she\u2019s the first Belizean bat scientist ever to pursue a PhD. Clare is delighted to be her supervisor.\n\n\u201cSomeone like Gliselle knows more about the area than I could possibly ever know,\u201d Clare says. \u201cShe grew up here. She knows the environment. And that means that we\u2019ll do better science because of it.\u201d\n\nThe country is a treasure trove of bat diversity (Marin says she can identify half of the some 75 species found here), but most of the people who study bats in Belize come from outside Belize.\n\nNancy Simmons is one such scientist. She\u2019s a curator of mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. She also helped recruit Marin and supported her in attending her first Bat-a-thon three years ago.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment I met her,\u201d Simmons says, \u201cI knew she had that love for what we do\u2026 that you don\u2019t care that you\u2019re hot and sweaty and bug-bitten because you\u2019re just so focused on learning about the animals.\u201d\n\nIt meant the world to Marin to receive that financial assistance. It\u2019s the kind of gift that can make all the difference to someone from a lower-resourced country like Belize.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to employ locals to help you,\u201d Marin says, \u201cbut to go above and beyond to mentor and support someone in going further is really what needs to happen.\u201d\n\nBy the time Marin attended her first Bat-a-thon, she\u2019d already completed her undergrad and Master\u2019s degrees \u2014 overseas. \u201cTo study the things I wanted to study,\u201d she says, \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay in Belize.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMarin has always come back to Belize, however \u2014 to work for nonprofits and NGOs, to do field work on bats, and to empower more Belizeans to take charge of protecting the natural legacy of their country.\n\ntoggle caption Luis Echeverr\u00eda for NPR\n\n\u201cConservation on a global scale has largely been dictated by European and Western ideals,\u201d Marin says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s changing slowly \u2014 but I think it needs to be changing a lot more quickly.\u201d\n\nMarin says those who come from abroad do important and necessary work, but there\u2019s a difference between someone who travels to a place for two weeks and someone who lives there. \u201cI think there\u2019s often a disconnect with applying that research to help to improve the country,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd as a Belizean, I think I can help to bridge that gap.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to involve the people of that country because they know what the values are,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey know the history of the country. I think we\u2019re leaders in conservation in many ways in Belize.\u201d\n\n\n\nA lifelong nature girl\n\nMarin grew up outdoors \u2014 she spent time exploring the ocean lapping the small islands just offshore of the mainland and the forests around her home outside of Belize City. But she had a clear preference. \u201cI always say I\u2019m more of a bush girl than a beach girl,\u201d she says, \u201c\u2018cause I would much rather be in the forest than lying on a beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a nature girl,\u201d says Marin\u2019s mother, Maria Estela Lara, recalling a story Marin wrote at age four about a little blue fish. \u201cShe\u2019s always had a love for animals.\u201d\n\nMarin, her sister, and her cousins used to make up their own nature-inspired holidays. When they spotted migrating birds, for instance, there was a bird day where they danced and banged pots and pans to celebrate the birds passing by overhead. Marin climbed a lot of trees and ate piles of mangoes. Being outside instilled in her an abiding appreciation for nature. \u201cWe always just felt like we were a part of it,\u201d she recalls.\n\ntoggle caption Luis Echeverr\u00eda for NPR\n\nLara says that connection with the natural world followed her daughter into adulthood.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cShe loves discovering things,\u201d her mother says. \u201cShe loves fighting for causes. She loves protecting wildlife. She\u2019s happiest when she\u2019s doing what she loves doing.\u201d\n\nLara sees her daughter\u2019s interest in bats as the latest application of this lifelong love of the natural world. \u201cShe can come back to Belize with the knowledge to help our country realize that we\u2019ve got to do something to protect these bats so that our environment is protected as well,\u201d she says. \u201cShe has a voice \u2014 and she uses her voice. If she sees injustices, she speaks up. I\u2019m very proud of her.\u201d\n\nGlis Marin, her dad, is proud of her too. His only concern is her job security in the future. \u201cI hope that someday, they\u2019ll appreciate what she\u2019s doing and she could have a good job here in Belize and start something that will really pay off for her.\u201d\n\nHer mom smiles. \u201cIf [Gliselle] chooses to build a hut out in the forest in nature and live and love bats, then I\u2019m fine with that,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cBut I\u2019m more of a romantic than her dad is.\u201d\n\n\n\nOld and new growth\n\nIn the steamy light of midday in northwestern Belize, Marin walks along a trail in the Belize Maya Forest, the location of her other bat field site. It\u2019s a protected rainforest where it\u2019s possible to spot tapirs and jaguars. She\u2019s part of a small group following Elma Kay, managing director of the forest\u2019s trust and Marin\u2019s longtime mentor.\n\nMost of the dense foliage is made up of younger trees and shrubs, but eventually Marin and the others reach the tree that Kay wants them to see.\n\ntoggle caption Luis Echeverr\u00eda for NPR\n\nThe tree is a towering mahogany, 75 feet tall, as wide as a car, that has probably been alive for a quarter of a millennium. Kay says it\u2019s not the largest tree around here, but it\u2019s up there \u2014 and impressive enough to elicit murmurs of admiration from the group.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe mahogany is an echo of a grander time, before its fellow giants were chopped down for lumber. \u201cEverything was like this,\u201d she says. \u201cMassive, very thick and big.\u201d\n\nKay has spent her career leading conservation efforts in Belize, mentoring young people and working towards sustainable development. She\u2019s also spent time abroad, training and leveling up. But just like Marin, she has always returned home to Belize.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely comforting that Gliselle keeps coming home,\u201d Kay says. \u201cIt\u2019s something that you do deliberately. It reassures me that she is the right person for having a positive impact in this country.\u201d\n\nSimmons agrees. She says, \u201c[Marin] can play an amazing role in connecting the research and conservation world to the people who live here and to the governmental officials and other people who make decisions that affect the landscape of the country.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Luis Echeverr\u00eda for NPR\n\nKay sees Marin joining a long tradition of Belizean women leading conservation efforts. After all, Kay acknowledges that she herself won\u2019t be doing this work forever.\n\n\u201cGliselle represents a new generation,\u201d she says. \u201cShe will eventually have to bring up the next generation to come.\u201d\n\nThe forest offers her a ready metaphor. \u201cYou have to have new trees coming up so that they can replace the old ones as they go down,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nThe whisper of a different future\n\nKay turns to the group. \u201cI think for the sake of time, we\u2019re gonna move on,\u201d she announces. There is one more stop to make.\n\nThe team drives for 10 or 15 minutes to the edge of the forest. Inside the vehicle there are gasps as the thick, protected forest suddenly gives way to\u2026 nothing. A windswept treeless expanse extends into the distance. The landscape has been obliterated by industrial machinery to make room for agriculture \u2014 corn, in this case. \u201cThis is not just any kind of agriculture,\u201d says Kay. \u201cThis is large-scale, mechanized, heavy-input driven agriculture.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFrom a lookout, Marin says she feels some anger when she sees this barren terrain, but mostly she feels a profound sense of loss. \u201cIt\u2019s always sad to come here and see more and more of the forest going,\u201d she says.\n\ntoggle caption Luis Echeverr\u00eda for NPR\n\nMarin says a scene like this adds to the urgency of her efforts to work with politicians and private landowners to protect more forest. It also motivates her to connect with the people of her country to convince them of why such protections are so crucial.\n\nIn fact, after absorbing the desolation privately, she turns to a young forest ranger in the group named Myro Sho and strikes up a soft conversation. She asks him what wildlife he\u2019s seen in the Belize Maya Forest. He talks about the birds and the jaguars.\n\n\u201cHave you noticed any bats flying around?\u201d she asks him. He can\u2019t recall any.\n\n\u201cI think once you learn where to look, sometimes you start seeing them,\u201d she says, as though sharing a secret.\n\nThen it\u2019s his turn for a question: \u201cSo you\u2019re from here?,\u201d he asks. Yes, she says. She\u2019s from Belize.\n\nMarin\u2019s grassroots approach, which relies on using bats as her partners to spread a message of conservation among locals, is central to how she intends to protect the wild places of Belize.\n\n\u201cWe have an amazing wealth of resources in Belize and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s lost on Belizeans, to be honest,\u201d she says. \u201cI think sometimes we just need a reminder. Some people feel like they don\u2019t have a voice or a role to play, but I think everyone does.\u201d\n\nFor Marin, it\u2019s about spreading a simple message: Everything is connected \u2014 people, the bats, the forest \u2014 and it all merits our care.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re as special as everything else around us,\u201d she says.\n\n",
