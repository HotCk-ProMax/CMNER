I	O
came	O
across	O
the	O

series	O
The	B-MISC
Accident,	I-MISC
which	O
is	O
currently	O

Top	O
10.	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
a	O
whirl,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
anything	O
because	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
accident	O
was.	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
watched	O
the	O
trailer,	O
which	O
gives	O
it	O
away,	O
but	O
because	O
it	O
does	O
(and	O
it's	O
revealed	O
in	O
the	O
opening	O
episode),	O
I	O
will	O
tell	O
you	O
what	O
the	O
accident	O
is:	O
At	O
the	O
party,	O
the	O
bounce	O
house	O

the	O

Unfortunately,	O
this	O
can	O
happen	O
(there	O
was	O
a	O
similar	O
tragedy	O
in	O
Maryland	O
not	O
long	O
ago),	O
but	O
this	O
is	O
only	O
the	O
inciting	O
incident.	O
As	O
we	O
follow	O
the	O
affected	O
families,	O
there	O
is	O
intrigue	O
over	O
a	O
business	O
deal,	O
there	O
is	O
an	O
affair,	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
scary	O
man,	O
there	O
is	O
a	O

and	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
tangled	O
tale	O
of	O
who	O
is	O
responsible	O
for	O
this	O
accident.	O
The	O
series	O
is	O
about	O
the	O
ways	O
these	O
people	O
are	O
changed	O
by	O
one	O
day	O
in	O
their	O
lives,	O
but	O
it	O
also	O
has	O
a	O
strong	O
undercurrent	O
of	O
soapy	O
drama.	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
the	O
show	O
is	O
terrific,	O
but	O
it's	O
very	O
watchable,	O
in	O
that	O
I	O
watched	O
all	O
10	O
episodes	O
in	O
a	O
single	O
day.	O
(Vacation!)	O
This	O
is	O
a	O
Mexican	O
drama,	O
and	O
it	O
made	O
me	O
think	O
about	O
how,	O
wherever	O
a	O
story	O
comes	O
from,	O
the	O
deepest	O
anxieties	O
often	O
echo	O
pretty	O
effectively.	O
A	O
nightmare	O
that	O
involves	O
kids,	O
families	O
that	O
start	O
placing	O
blame,	O
parents	O
who	O
are	O
trying	O
to	O
balance	O
career	O
and	O
family	O
responsibilities	O
with	O
devastating	O
costs	O
for	O
failure	O
–	O
it's	O
all	O
pretty	O
horrifying.	O
It's	O
hard	O
to	O
transition	O
with	O
the	O
words	O
"speaking	O
of	O
horrifying,"	O
but	O
I	O
also	O
watched	O
the	O
2019	O
Swedish	O
drama	O
series	O
Quicksand,	O
adapted	O
from	O
the	O
book	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
name,	O
which	O
begins	O
with	O
a	O
school	O
shooting.	O
A	O
young	O
woman	O
named	O
Maja	O
(Hanna	O
Ardéhn)	O
is	O
discovered	O
covered	O
in	O
blood	O
after	O
a	O
shooting	O
that	O
kills	O
several	O
people	O
(including	O
her	O
boyfriend),	O
and	O
over	O
six	O
episodes,	O
the	O
series	O
explores	O
what	O
her	O
role	O
was	O
and	O
what	O
culpability	O
she	O
has.	O
While	O
some	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
about	O
what	O
could	O
possibly	O
drive	O
anyone	O
to	O
commit	O
an	O
act	O
like	O
this,	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
also	O
about	O
the	O
toxicity	O
that	O
can	O
develop	O
in	O
relationships	O
between	O
teenagers,	O
particularly	O
ones	O
who	O
feel	O
alienated	O
from	O
friends	O
or	O
family.	O
Ardéhn	O
is	O
excellent,	O
as	O
is	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
cast,	O
and	O
the	O
story	O
walks	O
a	O
fine	O
line	O
between	O
sensitivity	O
and	O
mystery	O
as	O
it	O
provides	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
information	O
about	O
the	O
events	O
on	O
the	O
day.	O
YouTube	O
While	O
both	O
of	O
these	O
series	O
are	O
what	O
you	O
might	O
call	O
a	O
"tough	O
sit"	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
subject	O
matter,	O
it's	O
always	O
interesting	O
to	O
look	O
through	O
a	O
different	O
lens	O
at	O
storytelling	O
that	O
touches	O
on	O
familiar	O
things.	O
For	O
an	O
American	O
viewer	O
like	O
me,	O
both	O
series	O
drive	O
home	O
the	O
point	O
that	O
the	O
justice	O
system	O
works	O
differently	O
in	O
different	O
places	O
–	O
and	O
that	O
criminal	O
offenses	O
can	O
have	O
wildly	O
different	O
penalties	O
in	O
other	O
countries.	O
And	O
as	O
always,	O
I	O
do	O
recommend	O
watching	O
these	O
shows	O
with	O
subtitles,	O
for	O
the	O
simple	O
reason	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
your	O
attention.	O
You	O
can't	O

you	O
need	O
to	O

along,	O
and	O
there's	O
much	O
to	O
be	O
said	O
for	O
training	O
yourself	O
to	O
let	O
