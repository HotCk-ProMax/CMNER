And that can be nerve-wracking for everyone.\n\nTo help families ease into the transition, Life Kit asked teachers, pediatricians and child development experts for their best back-to-school advice. These tips have been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\ud83d\ude34 Adjust your child's summer sleep schedule to a school schedule. At least one or two weeks before school starts, move bedtime and wake-up time up by 15-minute increments every few days until the desired schedule is reached. \u2014 Dr. Nilong Vyas , pediatrician and sleep consultant\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\ud83d\udcdaGradually reintroduce structure into a child\u2019s daily routine to help them prepare for school. Add a 15-minute block of educational content to your kid\u2019s routine, such as a read-aloud, math puzzle or science experiment . \u2014 Keisha Siriboe , early childhood literacy consultant\n\n\ud83d\uddef Remind kids that almost everyone feels a little nervous on the first day of school. Naming and describing an emotion and letting children know you understand how they feel can help them feel more in control over their feelings instead of feeling overwhelmed by them. \u2014 Leah Orchinik , pediatric psychologist, Nemours Children's Health\n\n\ud83d\uddd3 To ease a child\u2019s anxiety about going back to school, help them understand what to expect. As Daniel Tiger sings, \u201cWhen we do something new, let\u2019s talk about what we\u2019ll do.\u201d Remind them that \u201cgrown-ups come back\u201d [at the end of the school day] \u2014 and they can share their new experiences at school with their loved ones. \u2013 Mallory Mbalia , director of learning and education at Fred Rogers Productions , producers of the TV show Daniel Tiger\u2019s Neighborhood\n\n\u2753Talk to your child about how they might handle challenging situations, even if they are not likely to happen. For example, if your son is worried about getting lost in a new school, help him problem solve by creating a plan about what he would do if that did happen so he feels more prepared and confident. \u2014Leah Orchinik, pediatric psychologist, Nemours Children's Health\n\n\ud83d\udc4b Make up a special goodbye ritual together. Morning goodbyes can be challenging. But you can create daily memories your child will cherish for years to come. Say, \u201cSee you later, alligator! In a while, crocodile!\u201d, do a special handshake or enjoy an extra-long hug. You can also kiss your child\u2019s palm and then hold each other\u2019s hands tightly to \u201cseal it in.\u201d Tell your child to remember they\u2019ll carry your kiss with them all day long, and they can do the same for you! \u2014 Jeanette Betancourt , senior vice president of U.S. social impact, Sesame Workshop\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u2615\ufe0f Fill their connection cup before and after school. Even if you're tired in the morning, set that alarm for 15 minutes earlier so you can have a snuggle session with your child. Read a book together. Have breakfast together. When you pick them up from school, be aware they will need another connection cup top-up. Sometimes they will present with this after-school meltdown because they're so depleted. \u2014 Vanessa Lapointe , author of Discipline without Damage\n\n\ud83e\udded Make sure your child knows how to navigate their world in tech-free ways. Even if your child has a smartphone, make sure they know what to do if they\u2019re approached by a stranger, how to get help for an injury and other street smarts. Help isn\u2019t always a button away. \u2014 Leah Plunkett , author of Sharenthood\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Discuss family or classroom conflicts with your child. Have a daily conversation topic such as, \u201cWhat\u2019s been a good or hard part about your day?\u201d or \u201cWhat rules do we need to help everyone feel loved and respected?\u201d Then have a weekly discussion to keep things on track and make kids part of problem-solving. \u2014 Thomas Lickona , author of How to Raise Kind Kids\n\n\ud83d\udce3 Pour positive words of affirmation into your children on a daily basis. For example, \u201cI love you. I\u2019m proud of you. It\u2019s going to be a great day. It's OK to make mistakes.\u201d Parents can leave notes inside their child's lunch boxes. Or I've had parents ask me to write a sticky note on their child's desk for them. These messages allow a kid to feel powerful and confident throughout the day. \u2014Jarod Renford, first grade teacher in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib.
