Busting 3 common myths about infidelity\n\ntoggle caption Adri\u00e1n Astorgano for NPR\n\nFrom an outsider\u2019s perspective, dealing with a cheating partner might seem obvious: cut your losses and run.\n\nBut Talal Alsaleem , who has helped hundreds of couples work through their infidelity in his 17 years as a clinical psychologist and licensed marriage and family counselor, says couples should do the opposite. First, they should turn toward each other. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean forgiving the wrongdoing, he says \u2013 it just means facing the problem head-on.\n\nHealing can look a lot of different ways, he says. \u201cSometimes infidelity is the clear signal that this relationship shouldn't have [existed] in the first place,\u201d says Alsaleem. But in other cases, it can present \u201ca golden opportunity\u201d for couples to address underlying issues and work together toward a stronger relationship.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlsaleem, founder of The Infidelity Counseling Center in Roseville, Calif., shares common misconceptions about romantic affairs -- and how to cope.\n\n\n\nMyth 1: Cheating means having sex with someone else\n\nCrossing the line means different things to different couples, says Alsaleem. In some relationships, flirting is considered cheating. In others, it\u2019s no big deal.\n\nSo explicitly define the boundaries of your relationship as early as possible. Couples assume they\u2019re on the same page about emotional or sexual exclusivity only to realize they\u2019re not when it\u2019s too late, he says.\n\nGet specific with each other. How do you feel about sexting? Porn? How close is too close to a friend or coworker? It might feel awkward to talk through these topics with your partner, says Alsaleem, but it\u2019s important to communicate clear boundaries.\n\nAnd if your partner \"is not willing to engage in conversation about exclusivity, that's a red flag,\" he adds.\n\n\n\nMyth 2: Once a cheater, always a cheater\n\nJust because someone cheated in a past relationship does not mean they\u2019ll cheat on you, says Alsaleem.\n\nBut you should make sure your partner worked on the issues that led them to cheating in the first place, says Alsaleem. Otherwise, if put in a similar situation, that person might repeat their mistakes.\n\nAnd remember: an affair is not a real relationship. \u201cYou only know the part of the person they choose to show you in the affair,\u201d says Alsaleem. \u201cLove requires you to be in a three-dimensional relationship where you see the good, bad and in-between.\u201d\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMyth 3: Cheating means your relationship is over\n\nNot everyone can or should forgive infidelity -- and it\u2019s OK to end a relationship to save yourself from unnecessary pain and suffering.\n\nHowever, in Alsaleem\u2019s experience, couples can and do recover from romantic affairs if they commit to it. \u201cIf people choose to rebuild their relationship for the right reason, they're going to end up with a better, healthier relationship than ever before,\u201d he says.\n\nIf that\u2019s a route you want to take, couples should take the time to understand the root cause of the transgression, says Alsaleem. It will help them heal from the trauma and avoid ending up in the same situation again, whether in the current relationship or future relationships.\n\nKeep in mind that forgiveness is earned, says Alsaleem. Rebuilding trust may require proactive transparency on the part of the unfaithful: sharing their location or phone and laptop passwords to prove there\u2019s nothing to hide -- at least early on.\n\n\u201cBreaking someone\u2019s heart \u2013 that\u2019s not a small thing, regardless of how far we went into the infidelity,\u201d says Alsaleem.\n\nThe digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib.
