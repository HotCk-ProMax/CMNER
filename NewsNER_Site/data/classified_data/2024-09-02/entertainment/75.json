Harris addressed AKA's annual convention in Dallas earlier that month.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe sorority's new political action committee \u2014 which complements an existing voter registration, education and mobilization coordinated campaign among the organizations \u2014 is the latest indication of a wave of enthusiasm for Harris among Black Americans, whose early and enthusiastic support helped ensure Harris' uncontested glide path to the nomination following Biden's withdrawal.\n\nIn the hours immediately after President Biden called it quits and backed Harris, the Win With Black Women political action committee spurred more than $1.5 million in fundraising in a Zoom donation drive and inspired a wave of similar efforts that raised tens of millions more.\n\nNow, Harris has a 51%-48% lead over former President Trump, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll \u2014 in part due to her strength among Black women and voters of color more broadly.\n\nThat strength is expected to make a number of states that once appeared to be slipping out of reach for Democrats under the Biden-Harris ticket, including Georgia and North Carolina, competitive come November.\n\nNPR reached out to Alpha Kappa Alpha for comment and did not immediately hear back.",
