If	O
you	O

laid	O
awake	O
at	O
night	O
worrying	O
about	O
relationships,	O
we	O
are	O
not	O
the	O

For	O
most	O

my	O
life,	O

rumination.	O
I’d	O
agonize	O
over	O
a	O

I’d	O
analyze	O

how	O
I	O
made	O

ponder	O
a	O

whether	O
my	O

A	O
couple	O
of	O

to	O
recognize	O
a	O
gap	O
in	O
the	O
kinds	O

relationships	O

wanted	O

mutual,	O

kind	O
of	O
relationships	O
I	O
actually	O
had	O
—	O
distant,	O
one-sided	O
and	O
(occasionally)	O
unhealthy.	O
The	O
space	O
between	O
desire	O

led	O
me	O
to	O

If	O
