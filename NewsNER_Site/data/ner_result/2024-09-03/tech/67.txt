from	O

Maximila	O
Imali,	O

of	O

other	O
athletes,	O
host	O
Rose	O
Eveleth	O
explores	O
a	O
question	O
that	O
goes	O
far	O
beyond	O
sports:	O
What	O
is	O
fair	O
and	O
who	O
decides?	O
Listen	O
to	O
the	O
trailer	O
here.	O
Some	O
argue	O
that	O
Mboma’s	O
and	O
Imali’s	O
bodies	O
give	O
them	O
an	O
“unfair	O
advantage.”	O
As	O
the	O
Olympic	O
Games	O
approach,	O
these	O
new	O
rules	O
put	O
athletes	O
in	O
a	O
difficult	O
position.	O
They	O
must	O
choose	O
between	O
altering	O
their	O
bodies,	O
giving	O
up	O
on	O
competition	O
at	O
the	O
elite	O
level,	O
or	O
trying	O
to	O
fight.	O
“Women’s	O

may	O

that	O

battle	O
over	O
what	O

to	O
