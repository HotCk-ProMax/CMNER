these,	O

it's	O

It	O

a	O

I	O
would	O
argue,	O
across	O
the	O

By	O
the	O
time	O
Kaepernick	O
does	O
what	O
he	O
does,	O
it's	O
now	O
15	O
years	O

that	O
in	O
which	O
patriotic	O
expression	O
is	O
narrowed	O
and	O
dissent	O
is	O
less	O
tolerated	O
in	O

Certainly	O
athletes	O
have	O
been	O
persecuted	O
before	O
Colin	O
Kaepernick	O
—	O
most	O
famously	O
Tommie	O

…	O
But	O
you	O
do	O
see	O
the	O
absolute	O
intolerance	O
and	O
the	O
vilification	O
of	O
Colin	O
Kaepernick,	O
which	O
I	O
would	O
argue	O
was	O
unprecedented,	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
it's	O
because	O
we	O
have	O
converted	O
the	O
stadium	O
into	O
a	O
pep	O
rally	O
for	O
the	O
military	O
and	O
for	O
law	O
enforcement.	O
Just	O
the	O
questioning	O
of	O
any	O
sort	O
of	O
police	O
action	O
becomes	O
intolerable,	O
especially	O
when	O
a	O
Black	O
athlete	O
does	O
it.	O
…I	O
think	O
that	O
that's	O
why	O
the	O
stadium	O
becomes	O
this	O
interesting	O
theater,	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
way	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
make	O
sense	O
of	O
our	O

and	O
of	O
American	O

And	O
I	O
definitely	O
think	O
that	O
there's	O
a	O
much	O
more	O
repressive	O
political	O

that	O
ensues	O
after	O
9/11	O

what	O

to	O
the	O

And	O
you	O
have	O
less	O

devoted	O
to	O
the	O
average	O

And	O
this	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
sports	O
fans	O
lament	O
over	O
and	O
over	O

And	O
you	O
could	O
say,	O
well,	O

could	O
just	O

watch	O
whatever	O

what	O
we	O

is	O
that	O
the	O

really	O
matters.	O
...	O
There	O
were	O

anymore?	O
And	O
the	O

showed	O
we	O
do	O

them.	O
And	O
that	O
the	O

want	O
them	O
there	O
and	O
that	O
the	O

wants	O
to	O
be	O
there.	O
....	O
Think	O
of	O
stadiums	O
as	O
institutions.	O
Think	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
places	O
where,	O
you	O
know,	O
people	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
congregate,	O
with	O
good	O
reason.	O
And	O
I	O
think	O
that,	O
that's	O
the	O
stadium	O
at	O
its	O
best	O
when	O
we	O
actually	O
use	O
it	O
for	O
