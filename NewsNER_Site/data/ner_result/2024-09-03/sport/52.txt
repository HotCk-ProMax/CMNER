For	O
a	O
long	O
time,	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
meat-and-potatoes	O
guy.	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
joke	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
opened	O
up	O
my	O
heart,	O
you'd	O
find	O
a	O
cheeseburger	O
inside.	O
But	O
over	O
the	O
past	O
year	O
or	O
so,	O
I've	O
embraced	O
vegetables.	O
You	O
could	O
even	O
call	O
me	O
a	O
salad	O
guy.	O
I'd	O
been	O
wanting	O
to	O
up	O
my	O
intake	O
of	O
fiber	O
and	O
nutrients,	O
and	O
eating	O
a	O
mix	O
of	O
greens	O
seemed	O
like	O
the	O
most	O
convenient	O
way	O
to	O
do	O
it.	O
The	O
thing	O
is,	O
salads	O
are	O
so	O
often	O
hit	O
or	O
miss.	O
Sometimes,	O
you'll	O
get	O
a	O
bowl	O
of	O
inspired	O
flavors	O
and	O
textures,	O
other	O
times,	O
you'll	O
get	O
watery	O
iceberg	O
lettuce	O
topped	O
with	O
baby	O
carrots.	O

So	O
I	O
turned	O
to	O
Jay	O
Guerrero,	O
a	O
Filipino	O
chef	O
and	O
cooking	O
instructor	O
based	O
in	O
Seattle,	O
and	O
Annette	O
Sacksteder,	O
a	O
naturopathic	O
physician,	O
to	O
help	O
me	O
out.	O
I	O
asked	O
them:	O
How	O
can	O
I	O
make	O
a	O
salad	O
I	O
won't	O
hate?	O
Something	O
nutritious,	O
affordable,	O
easy	O
to	O
make,	O
tasty	O
and	O
dare	O
I	O
say,	O
complex?	O
They	O
offer	O
up	O
creative	O
ideas	O
for	O
both	O
salad	O
haters	O
and	O
enthusiasts	O
alike.	O
Build	O
your	O
bowl	O
around	O
the	O
food	O
you	O
crave	O
It	O
may	O
sound	O
obvious,	O
but	O
"always	O
start	O
with	O
the	O
thing	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
eat,"	O
says	O
Guerrero.	O
You're	O
much	O
more	O
likely	O
to	O
eat	O
a	O
salad	O
filled	O
with	O
ingredients	O
you	O
like	O
than	O
a	O
salad	O
filled	O
with	O
ingredients	O
you	O
think	O
you	O
should	O
eat.	O
So	O
focus	O
on	O
what	O
you're	O
really	O
craving.	O
Maybe	O
that's	O
barbecue	O
chicken.	O
Or	O
miso-glazed	O
salmon.	O
Or	O
roasted	O
asparagus.	O
Cut	O
it	O
up	O
into	O
bite-size	O
pieces,	O
then	O
build	O
your	O
salad	O
around	O
that	O
ingredient.	O
Add	O
red	O
onion	O
for	O
bite.	O
Radishes	O
for	O
crunch.	O
Potatoes	O
for	O
bulk.	O
Then	O
finish	O
it	O
off	O
with	O
a	O
creamy	O
dressing.	O
You	O
can	O
also	O
always	O
sneak	O
in	O
more	O
vegetables.	O
"Throw	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
leaves	O
of	O
something	O
sturdy,	O
maybe	O
some	O
sliced-up	O
cabbage,"	O
says	O
Guerrero.	O
"Then	O
suddenly	O
you	O
actually	O
have	O
an	O
entire	O
meal."	O
Aim	O
for	O
a	O
balance	O
of	O
flavors	O
and	O
textures	O
As	O
a	O
kid,	O
Guerrero's	O
dad	O
made	O
the	O
same	O
salad	O
every	O
day.	O
He'd	O
toss	O
blanched	O
green	O
beans,	O
sliced	O
tomatoes	O
and	O
hard-boiled	O
eggs	O
with	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
salt	O
and	O
fish	O
sauce.	O
It's	O
a	O
salad	O
you'll	O
find	O
in	O
plenty	O
of	O
Filipino	O
households.	O

This	O
simple	O
salad	O
has	O
a	O
balance	O
of	O
flavors	O
and	O
textures,	O
says	O
Guerrero.	O
The	O
tomatoes	O
give	O
it	O
acidity,	O
the	O
green	O
beans	O
add	O
sweetness	O
and	O
bite,	O
and	O
the	O
fish	O
sauce	O
brings	O
the	O
umami	O
and	O
salt.	O
"The	O
variety	O
makes	O
things	O
interesting	O
for	O
your	O
mouth	O
and	O
sense	O
of	O
taste."	O
So	O
think	O
through	O
the	O
elements	O
of	O
your	O
salad.	O
If	O
there's	O
too	O
much	O
crunch,	O
add	O
creamy	O
ingredients	O
like	O
avocado	O
or	O
mozzarella	O
cheese.	O
If	O
your	O
salad	O
includes	O
mild-tasting	O
components	O
like	O
chickpeas	O
or	O
quinoa,	O
punch	O
up	O
the	O
flavor	O
with	O
some	O
candied	O
nuts	O
or	O
freshly	O
chopped	O
mint.	O

Strive	O
for	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
colors	O
when	O
choosing	O
vegetables	O
for	O
your	O
salad,	O
says	O
Sacksteder.	O
That	O
ensures	O
you're	O
getting	O
different	O
nutrients,	O

in	O
your	O

and	O
then	O
branch	O
out	O
to	O
yellow,	O
orange,	O

Think	O
rainbow	O
chard,	O
red	O
cabbage	O
or	O
grated	O
beet.	O
To	O
expand	O
your	O
salad	O
horizons,	O
pick	O
one	O
vegetable	O
you	O
know	O
nothing	O
about	O
and	O
give	O
it	O
a	O
try,	O
says	O
Sacksteder.	O
For	O
me,	O
that	O
was	O
daikon	O
radishes.They	O
have	O
a	O
sweet	O
and	O
peppery	O
crunch.	O
I	O
cut	O
them	O
up	O
into	O
pieces	O
and	O
toss	O
them	O
into	O
my	O
salads	O
like	O
I	O
do	O
with	O
regular	O
radishes.	O
Make	O
your	O
own	O
dressing	O
Store-bought	O
dressings	O
can	O
be	O
convenient.	O
But	O
Sacksteder	O
says	O
they	O
can	O
also	O
be	O
pricey	O
and	O
high	O
in	O
sugar.	O
Experiment	O
with	O
making	O
your	O
own.	O
Usually,	O
salad	O
dressings	O
combine	O
a	O
balance	O
of	O
acid,	O
like	O
lemon	O
juice	O
or	O
vinegar,	O
and	O
fat,	O
like	O
olive	O
or	O
canola	O
oil.	O
Use	O
the	O
three-to-one	O
rule	O
to	O
whip	O
up	O
a	O
vinaigrette:	O
three	O
parts	O
oil	O
to	O
one	O
part	O
acid.	O
Experiment	O
with	O
different	O
oils	O
and	O
vinegars	O
and	O
add	O
mustards,	O
spices	O
and	O
fresh	O
herbs	O
to	O
your	O
dressing.	O
Pure	O
maple	O
syrup	O
can	O
also	O
sweeten	O
things	O
up.	O
And	O
here's	O
an	O
idea	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
add	O
more	O
nuance	O
to	O
the	O
sweetness:	O
marinate	O
one	O
diced-up	O
clove	O
of	O
garlic	O
in	O
a	O
generous	O
dollop	O
of	O
maple	O
syrup	O
for	O
10	O
minutes,	O
then	O
add	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
dressing.	O
Sponsor	O

Guerrero	O
enjoys	O
improvising	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
dressing.	O
"I	O
do	O
like	O
a	O
glug	O
of	O

oil,	O
then	O

squeeze	O

what's	O
