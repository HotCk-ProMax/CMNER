    "text": "'Road to Rickwood': Roy Wood Jr. explores civil rights and baseball with new podcast\n\ntoggle caption WWNO/WRKF\n\nMay 20, 2024; LOUISIANA \u2014 In May 1963, Birmingham, Alabama became a lightning rod for the Civil Rights Movement after footage of local police attacking protestors with fire hoses and dogs was broadcast across the U.S. More than 60 years later, Road to Rickwood, launching May 28 and hosted by comedian and Alabama native Roy Wood Jr., examines the southern city's role in fights for freedom and equality by telling the story of Rickwood Field, the oldest professional baseball stadium in the country and its deep ties to the Negro Leagues, women's suffrage, and the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nIn June, Major League Baseball (MLB) will host \"MLB at Rickwood Field,\" the first-ever regular season MLB game at Rickwood to celebrate the history of the Negro Leagues. NPR Member Stations WWNO and WRKF are partnering on the new four-part series, with support from MLB.\n\nListen to the trailer here.\n\nMuch like Birmingham, Rickwood Field has a long and complicated history. The nearly 114-year-old stadium has hosted segregated baseball, a women's suffrage event, a Klan rally and \u2014 eventually \u2014 the first integrated sports team in Alabama.\n\n\"Rickwood Field is one of baseball's hidden gems,\" says host Roy Wood Jr. \"It's thrilling to be able to quarterback the story of a place that has been so near and dear to me since my time playing there in high school. If we're going to have a conversation about the Negro Leagues, then it's only fitting that one of the oldest stages to host these great players be a part of the conversation.\"\n\nRoy interviews historians, former Negro Leaguers, members of Birmingham's first integrated baseball team, MLB executives and other key players to learn how Birmingham's civil rights story played out at America's oldest ballpark.\n\nThe series includes Willie Mays' son describing how his father discovered baseball in his rural Alabama hometown and the pastor of the 16th Street Baptist Church reflecting on how Rickwood Field became a religious-like space to uplift the Black community in the 1940s and 1950s. Listeners will learn how Bull Connor went from Birmingham baseball announcer to city safety commissioner, where he unleashed dogs and hoses on youth protesters in his mission to uphold segregation. And the series digs into the archives to hear a speech from Jackie Robinson, after he came to Birmingham to join the growing civil rights movement.\n\nRoad to Rickwood is distributed by the NPR Network. It is produced by WWNO and WRKF, with support from MLB.\n\nAbout Roy Wood Jr. (Host)\n\nRoy Wood Jr.is a comedian, actor, Emmy-nominated documentary producer and former correspondent on the Daily Show.
