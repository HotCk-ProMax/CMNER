Weightlifting	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
to	O
exercise	O
efficiently	O
while	O
preventing	O
injury.	O
But	O
a	O
big	O
barrier	O
to	O
getting	O
started	O
is	O
"gymtimidation."	O
People	O
worry	O
they'll	O
hurt	O
themselves,	O
that	O
others	O
will	O
judge	O
them	O
or	O
that	O
they'll	O
look	O
stupid	O
at	O
the	O
gym.	O
Or	O
that	O
their	O
body	O
doesn't	O
fit	O
the	O
gendered	O
(and	O
unrealistic)	O
norm	O
of	O
what	O
an	O
"athletic"	O
body	O
looks	O
like.	O
To	O
overcome	O
this	O
fear,	O
fitness	O
experts	O
say	O
you'll	O
need	O
careful	O
planning	O
and	O
willpower	O
to	O
fight	O
against	O
the	O
ingrained	O
social	O
messages	O
about	O
who	O
strength	O
training	O
is	O
for	O
and	O
isn't	O
for.	O
Because	O
weightlifting	O
is	O
for	O
everyone.	O
"Bodybuilding	O
is	O
not	O
any	O
[more]	O
special	O
than	O

incrementally.	O
"A	O

a	O

that's	O
it,"	O
she	O

an	O

could	O
be	O
three	O
sets	O
of	O
five	O

of	O

presses	O
and	O
deadlifts	O
three	O

a	O

"So	O
you're	O

five	O

You	O
might	O
notice	O
your	O
plan	O
includes	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
exercises,	O
like	O
deadlifts,	O
squats	O
and	O
rows.	O
The	O
reason	O
beginner	O
plans	O
use	O
so	O
few	O
movements	O
is	O
because	O
they're	O
often	O
made	O
up	O
of	O
compound	O
movements,	O
efficient	O
exercises	O
that	O
use	O
your	O
muscles	O
together	O
the	O
way	O
they're	O
meant	O
to	O
be	O
used.	O
For	O
example:	O
During	O
an	O
arm	O
workout,	O
you	O
could	O
work	O
your	O
way	O
through	O
the	O
bicep	O
machine,	O
the	O
tricep	O
machine,	O
the	O
shoulder	O
press	O
machine	O
and	O
lateral	O
raises.	O
Or	O
you	O
could	O
do	O
a	O
bench	O
press	O
and	O
lat	O
pulldowns,	O
both	O
of	O
which	O
use	O
all	O
your	O
arm	O
muscles	O
together.	O
Compound	O
movements	O
allow	O
you	O
to	O
spend	O
less	O
time	O
at	O
the	O
gym,	O
get	O
through	O
your	O
workouts	O
more	O
quickly	O
and	O
focus	O
more	O
deeply	O
on	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
exercises.	O
