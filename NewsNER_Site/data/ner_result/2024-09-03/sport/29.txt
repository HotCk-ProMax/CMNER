without	O

that	O

with	O
the	O

he	O

“One	O
of	O
the	O
inmates,	O
a	O

had	O
said	O
to	O
me:	O
‘You	O

you	O

me	O

a	O

Rosetti	O

they	O
were	O

at	O
it.	O
“Most	O

It’s	O
something	O
they	O
say	O
they're	O
not	O
accustomed	O
to	O
as	O
many	O

only	O
offer	O
up	O
judgment	O
because	O

Or	O
as	O
Oneil	O

it:	O
"You	O
feel	O

you're	O
constantly	O
being	O
judged	O
at	O

“So	O
it's	O

should	O
I	O
care?'"	O
Oneil	O

"So	O
you	O

He	O

“You're	O

about	O
what	O

“One	O

at	O

Eulalia	O

the	O
programs	O
and	O
treatment	O
director	O
for	O
the	O
Connecticut	O
Department	O
of	O

Garcia	O
said	O
she’s	O
seeing	O
the	O
impact	O
of	O
the	O
pickleball	O
program.	O
“We've	O
seen	O
more	O
positive	O
interactions	O
with	O
other	O
individuals	O
from	O
our	O
participants	O
that	O
are	O
participating	O
in	O

we've	O
seen	O
a	O
healthier	O
outlook	O
on	O
their	O
future,”	O
Garcia	O
said.	O
“It's	O
something	O
that	O
they	O
value,	O
that	O
they	O
look	O
forward	O
to,	O
that	O
brings	O
them	O
happiness	O
and	O
motivates	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
better.”	O
Those	O
who	O
are	O
incarcerated	O
can't	O
undo	O
their	O
pasts.	O
But	O
Rossetti	O
said	O
he	O
wants	O
them	O
to	O
look	O
ahead	O
—	O
and	O
think	O
about	O
their	O
loved	O
ones	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
prison	O
walls.	O
"I	O
don't	O
care	O
if	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
on	O
certain	O
days	O
you	O
don't	O
deserve	O
to	O
win,"	O
Rossetti	O
said.	O
"There	O
are	O
other	O
people	O
that	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
for.	O
You	O
need	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
purpose	O
beyond	O
yourself.	O
I'm	O
sure	O
there's	O
someone	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
that	O
wants	O
you	O
home,	O
whether	O
it's	O
a	O
spouse	O
or	O

or	O

or	O

So	O
if	O
you're	O
not	O

do	O
it	O
for	O
yourself,	O
do	O
it	O
for	O
someone	O
else."	O
Rossetti	O
added:	O
“If	O
all	O
we	O
do	O
is	O

we've	O
