my	O
first	O

as	O
an	O
intern,	O
I	O
was	O
rattling	O
off	O
weird	O
ideas,	O
pipedreams,	O
strange	O
pitches—I	O
didn't	O
really	O
expect	O
anyone	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
seriously...I	O
was	O
blindsided	O
by	O
the	O
generosity.	O
Not	O
only	O
were	O
these	O
ideas	O
taken	O
seriously,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
encouraged	O
and	O
pushed	O
along.	O
The	O
people	O
here	O
at	O
NPR	O
have	O
helped	O
me	O
make	O
those	O
weird	O
ideas	O
into	O
real	O
videos	O
at	O
every	O
turn.	O
I	O
am	O
so	O
appreciative	O
of	O
everyone	O
who	O
has	O
lent	O
their	O
expertise.	O
It's	O
no	O
miracle	O
that	O
good	O
work	O

come	O
from	O
this	O
