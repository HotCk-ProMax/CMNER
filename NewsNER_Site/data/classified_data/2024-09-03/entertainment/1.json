He was sent to prison in 2019 for his online comments insulting Khamenei. He later wrote about the experience, including being flogged, according to Voice of America.\n\nIn early June, 35-year-old Shanbehadeh was arrested in Ardabil, northwestern Iran. According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, he told his family he wasn\u2019t sure why he was arrested, but it came shortly after he posted the response to Khamenei\u2019s tweet, which showed the Iranian leader with the country\u2019s national volleyball team.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nShanbehzadeh\u2019s post received far more \u201clikes\u201d than Khamenei\u2019s original tweet, according to Iran International English.\n\nShanbehzadeh is just the latest activist to be caught up in the hard-line government\u2019s crackdown on critics. Iran watchers say the leadership has felt insecure about the high level of dissent in the country for a while. Artists, playwrights, directors and others are also being swept up and given long prison sentences. In late April, Iranian rapper Toomaj Salehi was handed the death sentence for his antigovernment videos.\n\nShanbehzadeh was sentenced to five years for alleged pro-Israel propaganda activity, four years for insulting Islamic sanctities, two years for spreading lies online and an additional year for anti-regime propaganda.\n\nHis lawyer, Amir Raisian, told Shargh Network, a reformist newspaper in Iran, that he would appeal the verdict, especially the accusation of pro-Israel activity. The prosecutor\u2019s office in Ardabil alleged that Shanbehzadeh had been in contact with Israeli intelligence officers and was arrested when trying to leave the country, according to Voice of America.",
