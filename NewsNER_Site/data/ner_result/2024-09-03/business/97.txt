away	O

Trump	O
criticized	O
the	O

as	O

done	O
for	O
"Political	O
Purposes."	O
"This	O

In	O

a	O

told	O

that	O
the	O

from	O

—	O
and	O
she	O
intends	O
to	O

that	O

But	O
to	O
senior	O
fellow	O
at	O
the	O
Urban-Brookings	O
Tax	O
Policy	O
Center	O
Steve	O
Rosenthal,	O
this	O
idea	O
is	O
a	O
"bad"	O
one.	O
"We're	O
in	O
a	O
campaign	O
season	O
—	O
silly	O
season,"	O
Rosenthal,	O
who	O
has	O
years	O
of	O
experience	O
designing	O
tax	O
rules	O
for	O
Congress,	O
quipped.	O
"A	O
race	O
to	O
the	O
bottom	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
better	O
way	O
to	O
describe	O
tax	O
policy	O
here."	O
For	O
Rosenthal,	O
the	O
idea	O
fails	O
on	O
three	O
counts:	O
equity,	O
efficiency	O
and	O
revenue.	O
A	O
national	O
ban	O
on	O
taxing	O
tips	O
would	O
disproportionately	O
benefit,	O
for	O
example,	O
a	O
South	O
Carolina	O
server	O
who	O
earns	O
a	O
reduced	O
minimum	O
wage	O
and	O
makes	O
a	O
large	O
portion	O
of	O
their	O
income	O
through	O
tips.	O
While	O
a	O
server	O
in	O
California,	O
where	O
tips	O
make	O
up	O
a	O
smaller	O
portion	O
of	O
their	O
income,	O
would	O
benefit	O
less.	O
"Why	O
treat	O
employees,	O
who	O
perform	O
similar	O
kinds	O
of	O
services,	O
much	O
different	O
from	O
a	O
tax	O
standpoint	O
just	O
because	O
the	O
first	O
earn	O
tips	O
and	O
the	O
second	O
don't?"	O
the	O
tax	O
lawyer	O
said.	O
Rosenthal	O
went	O
on	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
a	O
no	O
tax	O
on	O
tips	O
law	O
would	O
be	O
extremely	O
difficult	O
to	O
efficiently	O
administer,	O
regulate	O
and	O
oversee.	O
"How	O
are	O
we	O
going	O
to	O
tell	O
who	O
is	O
receiving	O
a	O
tip,	O
and	O
when	O
that	O
tip	O
crosses	O
a	O
line	O
into	O
wages?"	O
Rosenthal	O
said.	O
"How	O
will	O
we	O
prevent	O
investment	O
bankers,	O
say,	O
from	O
getting	O
tips?	O
And	O
if	O
we	O
impose	O
income	O
limits,	O
well,	O
wouldn't	O
we	O
expect	O
low	O
paid	O
workers	O
just	O
to	O
demand	O
a	O
tip	O
rather	O
than	O
compensation?"	O
Ultimately,	O
he	O
said,	O
it	O
would	O
distort	O
the	O
labor	O
market.	O
But	O
the	O
biggest	O
barrier	O
for	O
Congress	O
is	O
the	O
money	O
they'd	O
lose.	O
"The	O
revenue	O
on	O
this	O
proposal	O
to	O
exempt	O
tips	O
from	O
taxation	O
is	O
something	O
like	O
a	O
couple	O
hundred	O
billion	O
over	O
a	O
10-year	O
period,"	O
he	O
said.	O
"That's	O
a	O
big	O
number	O
for	O
Congress	O
to	O
swallow."	O
Garrett	O
Watson,	O
senior	O
policy	O
analyst	O
at	O
the	O
Tax	O
Foundation,	O
largely	O
agreed	O
with	O
Rosenthal.	O
"The	O
underlying	O
policy	O
basis,	O
I	O
think,	O
is	O
weak	O
at	O
best,"	O
Watson	O
said.	O
He	O
also	O
pointed	O
to	O
a	O
recent	O
study	O
from	O
The	O
Budget	O
Lab	O
at	O
Yale	O
University,	O
which	O
found	O
that	O
only	O
2.5%	O
of	O
workers	O
would	O
benefit	O
from	O
a	O
no	O
tax	O

Despite	O
this,	O

from	O
both	O
campaigns	O
on	O
how	O
they	O
plan	O
to	O

this	O
relatively	O

"A	O

"Here,	O

I	O
definitely	O
