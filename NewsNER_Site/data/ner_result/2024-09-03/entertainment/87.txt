August	O
2009:	O
Oasis	O
abruptly	O
cancels	O
its	O
set	O
at	O
the	O
V	O
Festival	O
in	O
England,	O
with	O
Liam	O
blaming	O
a	O
case	O
of	O
laryngitis.	O
Years	O
later,	O
Noel	O
claims	O
his	O
brother	O
was	O
actually	O
hungover,	O
which	O
prompted	O
Liam	O
to	O
sue	O
him	O
for	O
libel	O
(he	O
eventually	O
dropped	O
the	O
suit).	O
That	O
month,	O
Noel	O
quits	O
the	O
band	O
for	O
real.	O
He	O
told	O
NPR	O
about	O
it	O
in	O
2012:	O
“We	O
were	O
backstage	O
waiting	O
to	O
go	O
onstage	O
to	O
30,000	O
people	O
in	O
Paris.	O
The	O
tour	O
manager	O
came	O
in	O
and	O
said,	O
'Five	O
minutes!'	O
We	O
broke	O
up	O
within	O
that	O
five	O
minutes.	O
I'm	O
not	O
proud	O
of	O
that,	O
but	O
all	O
things	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
end."	O

The	O
brothers	O
kept	O
slinging	O
insults	O
years	O
after	O
the	O
breakup	O
The	O
Gallaghers	O
kept	O
fighting	O
long	O
after	O
they	O
were	O
no	O
longer	O
bandmates,	O
insulting	O
each	O
other	O
in	O
awards	O

social	O

posts	O
(including	O
the	O
infamous	O
2016	O
“potato”	O
tweet,	O
which	O
became	O
a	O
yearslong	O
bit	O
of	O
its	O

There	O
were	O
occasional	O

for	O

interspersed	O
throughout	O

Liam	O
hinted	O
at	O
a	O
truce	O
in	O
2017	O
but	O
called	O
it	O
off	O
a	O
month	O
later.	O
In	O
2018,	O
he	O
tweeted	O
at	O
his	O
brother	O
suggesting	O
a	O
reunion,	O
but	O
after	O
no	O
reply	O
wrote,	O
“I’ll	O
take	O
that	O
as	O
a	O
NO	O
then.”	O
During	O
the	O
peak	O
of	O
the	O
COVID-19	O
pandemic,	O
Noel	O
released	O
a	O
previously	O
hidden	O
song	O
recorded	O
in	O
1995,	O
to	O
Liam’s	O
apparent	O
displeasure.	O
But	O
by	O
2023,	O
both	O
brothers	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
taking	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
a	O
reunion	O
more	O
seriously.	O
Notably,	O
that	O
same	O
year,	O
Blur	O
—	O
their	O
Britpop	O
archrival,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
hiatus	O
since	O
2015	O
—	O
reunited	O
to	O
release	O
an	O
album	O
and	O
perform	O
at	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
summer	O
festivals.	O
The	O
Ballad	O
of	O
Darren	O
was	O
critically	O
acclaimed,	O
with	O
outlets	O
from	O
the	O
BBC	O
to	O
Mojo	O
to	O
NPR	O
including	O
it	O
on	O
their	O
best-of-the-year	O
lists.	O
The	O
group	O
closed	O
out	O
its	O
triumphant	O
2023	O
by	O
announcing	O
another	O
hiatus.	O
“If	O
Oasis	O
hadn’t	O
had	O
reached	O
their	O
potential,	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
something	O
left	O
to	O
do,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
different,	O
but	O
I	O
just	O
don’t	O
see	O
what	O
the	O
point	O
would	O
be,”	O
Noel	O
said	O
in	O
a	O
January	O
2023	O
interview.	O
“It	O
would	O
be	O
make	O
a	O
load	O
of	O
money,	O
I’ve	O
got	O
a	O
load	O
of	O
money.	O
To	O
do	O
some	O
monumental	O
[venue]	O
I’ve	O
already	O
done	O
them."	O
But	O
he	O
left	O
the	O
door	O
open	O
to	O
the	O
possibility,	O
adding:	O
“Now,	O
that’s	O
not	O
saying,	O
in	O
10	O
years'	O
time,	O
it	O
won’t	O
appeal	O
to	O
me..."	O
Two	O
months	O
later,	O
Liam	O
responded	O
to	O
a	O
fan’s	O
tweet	O
asking	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
chance	O
Oasis	O
might	O
get	O
back	O
together.	O
“It’s	O
