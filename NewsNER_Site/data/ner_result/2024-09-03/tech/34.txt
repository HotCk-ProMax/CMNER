A	O
mosquito	O
can’t	O
infect	O
you	O
if	O
it	O
can’t	O
bite	O
you,	O
and	O
that	O
means	O
avoiding	O
going	O
outdoors	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
most	O
active,	O
from	O
dusk	O
until	O

If	O
you	O
do	O
go	O
outside	O
at	O
these	O
times,	O
it’s	O
important	O
to	O
cover	O
up	O
with	O
long	O
pants	O
and	O
long	O
sleeves	O
so	O
there’s	O
less	O
exposed	O
skin	O
for	O

nip	O
at,	O

whatever	O

You	O

an	O

Don’t	O
spray	O

Instead,	O
the	O

to	O
put	O

on	O
your	O
own	O
hands	O
and	O
then	O

the	O

by	O
dressing	O
them	O
in	O

love	O

you	O

they’ll	O
come	O
out	O

LaBeaud	O
welcomes	O
the	O
recent	O
attention	O
to	O
preventing	O
mosquito	O
bites,	O
because	O
as	O
she	O
notes,	O
“Mosquitoes	O
are	O
not	O
always	O
harmless,”	O
they	O
kill	O
more	O
people	O
than	O
any	O
other	O
creature	O
in	O
the	O
world.	O
Still,	O
she	O
says,	O
she	O
doesn’t	O
want	O
people	O
to	O
be	O
terrified	O
–	O
“just	O
recognize	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
have	O
a	O
health	O
impact,”	O
and	O
take	O
precautions.	O
