    "text": "Too hot for trout: Why some anglers are rethinking their approach to fly fishing\n\ntoggle caption Jonny Armstrong/U.S. Geological Survey\n\nMISSOULA, Mont. \u2014 In the early season, when the rivers are still running high and cool from snowmelt, KynsLee Scott loves trout fishing. As a fishing guide and conservationist, her life revolves around it, she says, standing in the shade of tall pines on the banks of the Blackfoot River.\n\nLately though, she says with a pause, \u201cIt\u2019s been harder to love, simply because of the changed environment.\u201d\n\nScott is an angler \u2014 one of many in the western U.S. \u2014 snagged in an ethical dilemma brought on by the \u201cabsolutely alarming\u201d shifts she\u2019s seen with a warming climate: When the trout you\u2019re fishing need cold water, and cold water is increasingly scarce, how and when should you fish?\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cFor me, unless I have to do it for my job, I don\u2019t feel good about coming out and targeting already stressed fish,\u201d she says. \u201cIt sucks. But we have to adjust what we\u2019re doing to have a resource at the end of the day.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR\n\nWestern Montana is particularly water-starved this year after a meager snowpack and scorching July . Hot water temperatures forced state officials to implement fishing restrictions on 17 rivers this summer, including \u2014 for a spell \u2014 the iconic Blackfoot, which is at its lowest level in 30 years. The so-called hoot owl restrictions prohibit fishing during the hottest part of the day to give fish a reprieve, forcing anglers to get out on the water early.\n\nMontana\u2019s fishing industry, which brings in nearly a billion dollars per year, is trying to adjust.\n\n\u201cPeople get concerned about what's causing [climate change] and all that. But that part to us doesn't matter,\u201d says Mike Bias, executive director of the Fishing Outfitters Association of Montana. \u201cThe reality is hatches are happening sooner. Flows are peaking earlier and tapering off. So what do we do? How do we adapt?\u201d\n\nSome guides in the Missoula area have moved their trips to colder rivers like the Missouri near Helena, where the water temperature is quasi-controlled by a series of dams. Others have shifted to targeting other fish like pike, which are invasive in some Montana watersheds. Almost all have shifted their fishing seasons, booking clients earlier in the spring and later in the fall.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real paradox for me,\u201d says John Herzer, who\u2019s been a fly fishing guide and outfitter on western Montana rivers for 35 years. On one hand, he says, \u201cthe fishing is still really good.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand: \u201cThere\u2019s just less and less water every year,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no question. Absolutely less water.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR\n\nTrout need cold water\n\nHumans have been trout fishing in western Montana for millenia. In the Missoula area, the Salish people were catching native bull trout on the Blackfoot River long before author Norman Maclean immortalized the \u201cArctic half-light of the canyon\u201d of the \u201cBig Blackfoot,\u201d as he called it, in his book A River Runs Through It.\n\nThe problem is the \u201cBig Blackfoot,\u201d like many rivers in the American West, isn\u2019t as big as it used to be. Invasive species like smallmouth bass and carp are crowding out native trout . Water is being siphoned off for agriculture, energy and towns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve degraded habitats, severed connections between [them] and introduced invasive species,\u201d says Clint Muhlfeld, a research ecologist at the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center. \u201cThose stressors combined with climate change are really causing some of these trout species to decline.\u201d\n\nPollution from cars, buildings and industry is raising global temperatures . As a result precipitation patterns are changing in Montana. Droughts are becoming more severe . Snowpacks are melting earlier .\n\n\u201cThe northern Rockies is actually warming at two times the rate of the global average,\u201d says Muhlfeld. \u201cThat\u2019s really changing our hydrology and, consequently, the water the fish live in.\u201d\n\nTrout need cold, oxygen-rich water to survive. Temperature thresholds vary by species, but all trout become sluggish and stressed when the water temperatures go beyond their comfort zone. Too hot, they\u2019ll die.\n\ntoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nIn 2015, Trout Unlimited, the nonprofit conservation group, published a report looking at the 28 different species and subspecies of trout and char that are native to the U.S. It found more than half of those species and subspecies have been squeezed into smaller ranges, occupying only a quarter of their historic range. Nearly all types of trout and char, the report found, face some level of risk.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMontana, Muhlfeld says, \u201cis home to some of the last remaining strongholds for native fish species.\u201d But it isn\u2019t invulnerable to change.\n\nA study Muhlfeld co-authored in 2022 found that more than one-third of Montana\u2019s cold-water fisheries could be unsuitable for trout by 2080, costing the state nearly $200 million in lost revenue.\n\n\u201cThe lower reaches of all these famous trout rivers are going to get warm the quickest,\u201d says Timothy Cline, the study\u2019s lead author, who\u2019s now an ecologist at Montana State University. \u201cWe might lose some of those lower reaches on the Madison, Blackfoot, the Bitterroot, the Big Hole.\u201d\n\nFortunately, though, he says, their study also found that trout and the industry that relies on them, are still resilient. Higher elevation rivers and cool mountain streams and lakes still offer refuges. Trout are adaptable and will move to more agreeable conditions when they\u2019re able.\n\n\u201cThe hope is that by maintaining and protecting all those options we can have robust trout fisheries and opportunities in the future,\u201d Cline says.\n\n\n\nGiving trout room to move\n\nIn some cases, maintaining and improving fish habitat requires removing relics of the past.\n\nNorth of Missoula, on Rattlesnake Creek, which merges with the Clark Fork River downstream of the Blackfoot, a coalition of agencies and groups are working to decommission a series of now defunct dams that stretch into the Rattlesnake Wilderness.\n\n\u201cFish that can\u2019t get up into cold water are going to have a harder time dealing with climate change and warm waters,\u201d says Warren Colyer, the Western Water and Habitat program director at Trout Unlimited. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to remove those barriers.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Jason Jaacks/Resources Legacy Fund\n\nColyer and his colleague, Christine Brissette, are standing on the edge of Rattlesnake Creek just upstream of a deep pool, which denotes where one of the dams was removed in 2021.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cWe saw immediately after this dam removal fish that had been tagged at the mouth of the creek hanging out just above where the dam used to be,\u201d Brissette says. \u201cThey moved into this habitat immediately.\u201d\n\nTrout Unlimited and other conservation groups are working to restore floodplains, creating artificial beaver dams in places to slow runoff. They\u2019re working with irrigators to limit withdrawals during periods of severe drought.\n\nEarlier this year, the Blackfoot Challenge, a coalition of landowners, public agencies, and conservation groups that live and work along the Blackfoot River, pushed irrigators along the Blackfoot to voluntarily reduce demand on the river\u2019s water and anglers to shift their techniques, including by using barbless hooks.\n\n\u201cEvery guide has a responsibility to change how we are utilizing our water resources, especially for these cold water fisheries,\u201d Scott says on the banks of the Blackfoot.\n\nFish are a finite resource, she says. Climate change is worsening conditions. \u201cWith those two combined there\u2019s only a limited time in which we can continue to adjust,\u201d she says.\n\nAsked how Scott thinks her job will change in the future, if a river will still run through it, she laughs.\n\n\u201cA river will still run through it,\u201d Scott says. \u201cAnd it might be a trickle.\u201d",
