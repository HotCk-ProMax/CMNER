    "text": "'I got you, girl': A toll collector's unexpected reply to a driver's tears\n\ntoggle caption Leahruth Jemilo\n\nThis story is part of the My Unsung Hero series, from the Hidden Brain team. It features stories of people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone else.\n\nIn January 2021, Leahruth Jemilo and three friends decided to book a weekend getaway. Jemilo was having a tough week at work, and by the Friday before the trip, she didn\u2019t know if she could go.\n\n\u201cMy tank was completely empty,\u201d Jemilo said. She called her friends to cancel.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cI was crying to them saying, \u2018I'm so anxious. I'm just exhausted from the week. I just don't think that I even have the energy to get in the car,\u2019\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cAnd they said, \u2018Do it, just get in the car.\u2019 So I listened to my girlfriends, got in the car and started driving.\u201d\n\nAs she drove down the highway, Jemilo started to cry. She put on her sunglasses to hide her tears, and pulled up to a toll booth at the Chicago Skyway Toll Bridge. Then she noticed her toll collector.\n\n\"She had these really beautiful, very bright purple long braids in her hair, and was wearing these incredible, really long purple feather earrings,\u201d Jemilo recalled.\n\nThe worker said hello, and asked Jemilo how she as doing.\n\n\u201cAnd I immediately burst into tears and I said, \u2018I am actually not good. I am really not good.\u2019\u201d\n\nJemilo took off her sunglasses and tears streamed down her face. Then the toll collector said something to her that she won\u2019t forget.\n\n\u201cShe looked at me and her eyes were so kind. And she pointed her finger at me and she said, \u2018Listen, I got you, girl. You're going to be in my prayers. And everything is going to be OK,\u2019\u201d Jemilo said.\n\n\u201cMy tears actually dried up when she said that. And I felt lighter in that moment.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nJemilo thanked the woman, paid the toll and went on her way. Then she found herself crying again \u2014 this time with tears of happiness.\n\n\u201cHer simple act of kindness in response to what is typically a very simple question ... was incredibly meaningful to me in that moment,\u201d Jemilo said.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing to me that she showed that kind of kindness to a stranger who just happened to be driving through her part of the tollbooth.\u201d\n\nMy Unsung Hero is also a podcast \u2014 new episodes are released every Tuesday.
