Try these 4 recipes at home\n\ntoggle caption Ba Bar\n\nIt\u2019s nearing Labor Day \u2014 the unofficial end of summer \u2014 which means cucumber season is coming to a close. And, if you\u2019re trying to get a few more summer salads in before then, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nTikTok\u2019s most recent food craze is cucumber salad. And social media creator Logan Moffitt, known as @ logagm on TikTok, has been posting near-daily cucumber salad recipe videos that have inspired TikTok users to eat an entire cucumber in one sitting.\n\nEach video starts with some variation of, \u201cSometimes you need to eat an entire cucumber, this is the best way to do it.\u201d Moffitt then slices a cucumber on a mandoline \u2014 a feat that has proven dangerous for some TikTok users \u2014 then adds sauce before giving everything a good shake.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMany of Moffitt\u2019s recipes \u2014 like this one \u2014 are variations on an Asian cucumber salad \u2014 and ingredients are never measured:\n\n\n\nSoy sauce\n\nFish sauce\n\nSesame oil\n\nMSG\n\nRice wine vinegar\n\nOne grated clove of garlic (again, be careful with the grater)\n\nSugar\n\nChili oil\n\nGreen onion\n\nHis videos have inspired a flurry of TikTok users creating their own takes on cucumber salad:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe one that I was most intrigued by was the cream cheese and lox and everything bagel one,\u201d said user @soogia1.\n\nthat I was most intrigued by was the cream cheese and lox and everything bagel one,\u201d said user @soogia1. User @forevaheatha did the \u201cCalifornia roll inspired cucumber salad \u201d\n\n\u201d \u201cI\u2019m thinking we do like feta, spinach, onion, garlic, lemon, olive oil, that kind of vibe ,\u201d user @whitneyhanslow said.\n\n,\u201d user @whitneyhanslow said. User @saltnpiipa made a \u201ccucumbery, peanut buttery, Asian-infused bowl of deliciousness .\u201d\n\nWhen you\u2019re not in the mood to whip up a multi-ingredient dish, you can always eat cucumbers raw with a bit of sea salt and olive oil.\n\nBut for those ready to try out some new cucumber recipes, we asked a few chefs for their favorite ways to eat a cucumber.\n\n\n\nChef Banh\u2019s Cucumber Shrimp Salad:\n\ntoggle caption Look at Lao Studios/Eric Banh\n\nEric Banh, a Chinese-Vietnamese chef and restaurateur from Seattle says he likes to start with an English cucumber \u2014 the big ones that often come in plastic at the grocery store \u2014 \u201cbecause [of] the consistency of it and it also has a better crunch.\u201d\n\nOne of Banh\u2019s favorite cucumber dishes is his cucumber shrimp salad.\n\n\u201cWe mix it with our pickled pickled carrots and daikon, which is a classic Vietnamese pickled radish,\u201d Banh told NPR\u2019s Morning Edition.\n\nHe then adds pineapple, cooked shrimp and dried shrimp.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cI think the magic and the secret is dried shrimp,\u201d Banh said. \u201cYou just soak it in lukewarm running water for about 30 seconds.\u201d\n\nHe tosses it in a dressing made from anchovy fish sauce, water, sugar, garlic and lime juice.\n\nChef Banh\u2019s vegan cucumber salad:\n\nHe usually leaves most if not all of the peel on \u2014 unless he\u2019s making his vegan cucumber salad. For that one, he\u2019ll peel and slice a cucumber in half lengthwise, then cut it into pieces diagonally \u2014 but save the peels.\n\nNext, he adds water, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar and the cucumber peels to a blender, purees it up and dresses the cucumbers in the vinaigrette.\n\n\u201cAnd now you've got this beautiful green color,\u201d Banh said. \u201cYou can marinade this an hour ahead before your party or overnight.\u201d\n\n\n\nChef Bhatt\u2019s Raita:\n\ntoggle caption Sierra Hollis\n\nIf you\u2019re craving something creamy, Vishwesh Bhatt, the chef at Snackbar in Oxford, Miss. says make a raita \u2014 an Indian yogurt-based sauce.\n\n\u201cIt's very similar to the Turkish or Greek tzatziki,\u201d Bhatt said. \u201cEssentially you take cucumbers, add some chilies or onions and then mix all that with a little lemon juice and yogurt and some toasted cumin and some mustard that\u2019s tempered in oil then folded in,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nChef Bhatt\u2019s Benedictine spread:\n\nOr \u2014 you can make a Benedictine spread, a mayo-based spread from the American South that\u2019s traditionally bright green from food coloring.\n\nChef Bhatt makes his with cucumbers, fresh dill, parsley, a little bit of garlic and onion \u2014 but instead of a mayonnaise base he uses cream cheese, then adds a bit of mascarpone cheese.\n\n\u201cI like the creaminess of the mascarpone,\u201d Bhatt said. \u201cI don't use food coloring because I don't think it's necessary.\u201d",
