Did he help prevent forest fires?\n\ntoggle caption FPG/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nThe longest-running public service announcement in the U.S. turns 80 years old today.\n\nIts message is simple and one you\u2019ve heard many times before: \u201cOnly you can prevent wildfires.\u201d Smokey Bear, the beloved park ranger hat-wearing black bear who utters these famous words has undergone a complicated evolution.\n\nAnd his birthday comes as fires rage in California, Colorado and other Western states. On average, some 70,000 wildfires have been documented every year in the U.S. since 1983, according to data from the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nHuman-caused climate change has made these fires more intense and dangerous, but it isn\u2019t the only factor: Federal data and various independent studies show that around 80% of all wildfires in the country are caused by humans, making Smokey\u2019s message more relevant than ever.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSo we\u2019re taking a look back at how Smokey Bear\u2019s mission came to be and how effective his messaging has been.\n\n\n\nHow World War II influenced Smokey Bear\u2019s creation\n\ntoggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nSmokey Bear\u2019s public service ad was created at the height of World War II in 1944. The U.S. Forest Service had been fighting forest fires for years, but the attack on Pearl Harbor brought a greater need for fire safety messaging, as firefighters were deployed overseas.\n\n\u201cWhen this campaign first launched, it was in the context of our war efforts, and the forests were seen as a resource in that context,\u201d said Tracy Danicich, director of the Smokey Bear campaign at the Ad Council.\n\nA few weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, a Japanese submarine sitting off the coast fired shells at an oil facility in Santa Barbara County, Calif. south of the Los Padres National Forest. The attack raised fears that more attacks like this could cause wildfires in forests along the Pacific coast. The Forest Service hoped that connecting the risk of fires to the war effort would help make the case for fighting forest fires more urgent.\n\n\u201cThere was also a rise in wildfires just from general human carelessness, lack of respect for fire, perhaps lack of knowledge of how to contain and properly respect a fire,\u201d said Tad Bennicoff, a reference archivist at the Smithsonian Institution archives. \u201cSo the Forest Service came up with the idea of the Smokey Bear character and the message.\u201d\n\nBut even after World War II ended, Smokey stuck around. He started showing up on posters, U.S. Postal Service stamps, in radio ads and alongside stars like Bing Crosby and Ward Bond.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nYou might remember calling the forest fire fighting black bear \u201cSmokey the Bear,\u201d but that isn\u2019t actually his name.\n\nIn 1952, singers Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins wrote a jingle for and added a \u201cthe\u201d to maintain the song\u2019s rhythm. This inadvertently created confusion about the bear\u2019s name, but the U.S. Forest Service maintains that Smokey\u2019s official name is \u201cSmokey Bear,\u201d not \u201cSmokey the Bear.\u201d\n\nThe campaign\u2019s mascot was an actual bear rescued from a wildfire\n\ntoggle caption Charles Sykes/Charles Sykes/Invision/AP/Invision\n\nIn the spring of 1950, a group of Native American firefighters rescued a bear cub who clung to a tree as a fire raged in the Capitan Mountains in New Mexico.\n\nAfter its rescue, the cub became the symbol of the Smokey Bear campaign and was put on display at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut the physical public service announcements, which for years showed a black bear in a pair of blue pants, a tan wide-brimmed park ranger\u2019s hat and a metal shovel, confused some zoo goers.\n\nBennicoff said this outfit was so closely associated with Smokey that some young kids were bewildered when they saw a naked bear at the National Zoo.\n\nVisitors were startled to see a real bear, Bennicoff said. \u201cThey were expecting to see the Smokey Bear that they saw in print ads and on television. But lo and behold, there's this actual bear.\u201d\n\nForest Service cartoon of Smokey Bear welcoming Little Smokey./Smithsonian Institution Archives\n\nTo help with the confusion, the zoo added a special exhibit next to Smokey\u2019s enclosure that featured a park ranger\u2019s uniform in Smokey\u2019s size. During this time, Smokey Bear was receiving so much fan mail that the Zoo had to hire three assistants to keep up with the amount of letters he was getting. He even got his own ZIP code \u2014 an honor only bestowed to one other figure: the president.\n\nSmokey retired from the zoo at 25. In human years, he would have been roughly 70, the mandatory retirement age for federal employees at the time. In 1971, the zoo introduced \u201cLittle Smokey,\u201d another orphan cub rescued by the Forest Service. When Smokey retired, Little Smokey took over the mantle.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe original Smokey died Nov. 9,1976, a year after his retirement. His remains were returned to New Mexico, where he was buried in the Smokey Bear Historical Park in Capitan, N.M., not far from where he was rescued two decades prior.\n\nA small change for Smokey represents a big change for environmentalism\n\ntoggle caption Jae C. Hong/AP/AP\n\nFor five decades, Smokey\u2019s slogan remained the same: \u201cOnly you can prevent forest fires.\u201d The message suggested that all fires were preventable and bad for the environment and that nature could return to its original state if fires didn\u2019t occur.\n\nIn one ad, Smokey said that if people just took his message into their hearts, it could be like \u201cthe old times, maybe, when great herds of buffalo roamed.\u201c\n\nMelinda Adams, an Indigenous fire scientist and assistant professor in the Department of Geography and Atmospheric Science at the University of Kansas told Morning Edition that Smokey\u2019s vision of an America without wildfires isn\u2019t accurate.\n\n\u201cWhen you had colonizers come over and look at land, mosaics or beautiful landscapes, they developed a narrative of [these] being untouched by humans, virgin lands. They arrived and the lands were like that,\u201d Adams said. \u201cBut we know through the recent scholarship that that's not true. We know that Indigenous peoples created these landscapes or maintained them.\u201d\n\nAdams is a proponent of what she calls good fire \u2014 or burns to land that help an environment thrive. This practice is also called prescribed burning.\n\nThis is one of the reasons that in 2001, Smokey Bear changed his slogan from only you can prevent forest fires to only you can prevent wildfires. This change in messaging also represented a change in how the U.S. Forest Service approached fire treatment.\n\n\u201cNow, the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S Department of Agriculture are redirecting resources to good fire, beneficial fire during the off fire season in order to reduce the overgrowth that, you know, decades of fire suppression of fire deficiency has left, which makes those areas of lands more flammable,\u201d Adams said.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe road ahead for Smokey\n\ntoggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nMost wildfires are still caused by human activity, which raises the question: Has Smokey\u2019s messaging actually been effective?\n\nJohn Miller, the chief of Fire and Emergency Response at the Virginia Department of Forestry, said that there is still a lot of work to be done to educate the public on fire safety.\n\nIt's not enough, Miller said, for officials who work in fire prevention education to stand \"with [their] arm around Smokey Bear shouting fire prevention on an occasional TV commercial or at a school near you or at a county fair with a booth. Somehow we need to turn that prevention into more to be more front and center to the public.\"\n\nMiller believes that one of the big problems is that people are not aware of smaller fires that occur in areas like Virginia all the time.\n\n\u201cThankfully, because of quick and efficient suppression those fire hours are suppressed quickly. They don't become newsworthy,\" Miller said. \u201cIf it hadn't impacted a home or damaged the public just never hears about that.\u201d\n\nMiller thinks these smaller fires can be prevented, especially because they are often caused by humans who are not aware of simple ways they can be practicing fire safety.\n\nWhich is exactly what Smokey Bear\u2019s evolving message is \u2014 the best way to continue to spread awareness about safe fires.\n\n\u201cHis tips evolve, and there are other things about Smokey and the campaign that have evolved to stay relevant, but that message and focus has always remained consistent,\u201d Danicich said.\n\nThis digital story was edited by Obed Manuel.",
