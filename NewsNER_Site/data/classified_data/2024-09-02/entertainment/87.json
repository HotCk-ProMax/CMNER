Now, new evidence by researchers in Egypt suggest more harrowing details.\n\nOn Friday, Cairo University radiologist Dr. Sahar Saleem and anthropologist Samia El-Merghan reported that the woman may have \u201cdied screaming from agony or pain.\u201d The evidence was found using CT scans and other tools. The study was published Friday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine.\n\nThe researchers added that the woman\u2019s facial expression might have been caused by cadaveric spasm, which occurs during \u201csevere physical or emotional activity.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThey also estimated that the woman died at 48 years old and was about 5-foot-1.\n\nThe findings were not definitive and the study emphasized that a mummy\u2019s appearance could be affected by a range of factors, from the burial procedures to post-mortem alterations.\n\nBut it proved more plausible than the theory that embalmers simply neglected to properly wrap her mouth closed \u2014 which likely explained other ancient Egyptian mummies with open mouths.\n\nBut the researchers did not find evidence to suggest that the woman had a poor mummification process.\n\n\u201cThe funerary techniques the embalmers employed on the corpse of mummy CIT8, including the use of a wig, rings, pricey imported embalming materials, and placing the mummy in a wooden coffin, [indicated] good mummification quality,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe mummy\u2019s cause of death remains unknown. The \u201cScreaming Woman\u201d was discovered between 1935 and 1936 near the tomb of Senmut in Luxor and later stored at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. She was believed to be his relative, according to the study.\n\nSenmut was an architect during the reign of ancient Egypt\u2019s most powerful female leader, Queen Hatshepsut. Senmut\u2019s final years also remain a mystery.",
