is	O
not	O
a	O

about	O
gun	O
control,	O
but	O
that's	O
where	O
the	O
story	O
begins,	O
with	O
three	O
moms	O
reeling	O
from	O
a	O
school	O
shooting.	O
In	O
March	O
2023,	O
a	O
mass	O
shooter	O
attacked	O
The	O
Covenant	O
School,	O
a	O
private	O
Christian	O
school	O
in	O
Nashville,	O
and	O
killed	O
six	O
people.	O
Within	O
weeks,	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
surviving	O
students’	O
mothers	O
step	O
inside	O
the	O
Tennessee	O
state	O
capitol	O
—	O
where	O
Republicans	O
outnumber	O
Democrats	O
three	O
to	O
one	O
—	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
in	O
their	O
lives	O
to	O
advocate	O
for	O
gun	O
control.	O
When	O
they	O
do,	O
they	O
come	O
face-to-face	O
with	O
the	O
brute	O
force	O
of	O
a	O
politically	O
lopsided	O
legislature,	O
while	O
also	O
coming	O
face-to-face	O
with	O
their	O
own	O
long-held	O
beliefs.	O
“These	O
women	O
were	O
shocked	O
to	O
find	O
themselves	O
at	O
odds	O
with	O
the	O
Republican	O
party,”	O
Knight	O
said.	O
"What	O
they	O
discovered	O
is	O
that	O
very	O
few	O
legislators	O
really	O
wanted	O
to	O
listen.	O
And	O
that's	O
because	O
they	O
don't	O
have	O
to.	O
Not	O
only	O
do	O
Republicans	O
control	O
the	O
legislature,	O
they	O
also	O
have	O
the	O
governor’s	O
office,	O
which	O
essentially	O
gives	O
them	O
power	O
over	O
the	O
state’s	O
entire	O
political	O
agenda.”	O
As	O
Knight	O
reveals	O
in	O
her	O
reporting,	O
in	O
single	O
party-led	O
states	O
like	O
Tennessee,	O
lawmakers	O
have	O
taken	O
increasingly	O
extreme	O
measures	O
to	O
exercise	O
their	O
power	O
and	O
tamp	O
down	O
dissenting	O
views.	O
Whether	O
Democrat	O
or	O
Republican,	O
twenty-nine	O
states	O
have	O
legislatures	O
where	O
one	O
party	O
has	O
a	O
steep	O
advantage	O
over	O
the	O
other.	O
This	O
