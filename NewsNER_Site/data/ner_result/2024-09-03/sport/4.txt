the	O

who	O

A	O
surprise,	O
then	O
a	O
discovery	O
The	O
new	O
research	O
was	O
prompted	O
by	O
a	O
lab	O
experiment	O
that	O
didn’t	O
go	O
as	O
planned.	O
A	O
team	O
at	O
Stanford	O
was	O
studying	O
an	O
enzyme	O
called	O
IDO1	O
that	O
plays	O
a	O
key	O
role	O
in	O
keeping	O
a	O
cell’s	O
metabolism	O
running	O
properly.	O
They	O
suspected	O
that	O
in	O
Alzheimer’s	O
disease,	O
IDO1	O
was	O
malfunctioning	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
that	O
limited	O
the	O
brain’s	O
ability	O
to	O
turn	O
nutrients	O
into	O
energy.	O
So	O
the	O
team	O
used	O
genetics	O
to	O
eliminate	O
the	O
enzyme	O
entirely	O
from	O
mice	O
that	O
develop	O
a	O
form	O
of	O
Alzheimer’s.	O
They	O
figured	O
that	O
without	O
any	O
IDO1,	O
brain	O
metabolism	O
would	O
decline.	O
“We	O
expected	O
to	O
see	O
everything	O
[get]	O
much,	O
much,	O
much	O
worse”,	O
says	O
Dr.	O
Katrin	O

a	O
professor	O

neurology	O
and	O
neuroscience	O
at	O
Stanford.	O
“But	O
no,	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
complete	O
opposite.”	O
Without	O
the	O
enzyme,	O
the	O
mouse	O
brains	O
were	O
actually	O
better	O
at	O
turning	O
glucose	O
into	O
energy	O
and	O
didn’t	O
exhibit	O
the	O
memory	O
loss	O
usually	O
associated	O
with	O
Alzheimer’s.	O
“It	O
was	O
such	O
a	O
profound	O
rescue	O
that	O
we	O
sort	O
of	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
drawing	O
board	O
and	O
tried	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on,”	O

Eventually,	O
the	O
team	O
found	O
an	O
explanation.	O
Getting	O
rid	O
of	O
the	O
enzyme	O
had	O
altered	O
the	O
behavior	O
of	O
cells	O
called	O
astrocytes.	O
Usually,	O
astrocytes	O
help	O
provide	O
energy	O
to	O
neurons,	O
the	O
cells	O
that	O
allow	O
for	O
learning	O
and	O
memory.	O
But	O
when	O
the	O
toxic	O
plaques	O
and	O
tangles	O
of	O
Alzheimer’s	O
begin	O
to	O
appear	O
in	O
the	O
brain,	O
levels	O
of	O
IDO1	O
rise	O
and	O
astrocytes	O
stop	O
doing	O
this	O
job.	O
“They’re	O
kind	O
of	O
put	O
to	O

Andreasson	O
says.	O
So	O
“you’ve	O

to	O
wake	O
them	O
up	O
to	O

them	O
to	O

the	O

And	O
that’s	O
what	O
happened	O
when	O
scientists	O
used	O
genetics	O
to	O
remove	O
IDO1.	O
Their	O
hypothesis	O
was	O
that	O
high	O
levels	O
of	O
IDO1	O
were	O
limiting	O
the	O
astrocytes’	O
ability	O
to	O
produce	O

a	O

that	O

confirm	O
the	O
hypothesis,	O
the	O
team,	O
led	O
by	O
Dr.	O
Paras	O

,	O
did	O
a	O
series	O
of	O

One	O

placing	O
a	O

“It	O

Andreasson	O

“But	O
it	O
has	O
to	O
learn	O
where	O
the	O

is”	O
by	O
following	O

learned	O
how	O
to	O
read	O
those	O
cues	O
after	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
of	O

and	O
would	O
escape	O
almost	O
instantly.	O
“But	O
in	O
the	O

the	O
