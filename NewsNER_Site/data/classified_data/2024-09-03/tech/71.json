In the weekly radio program, show creator, producer, and host, Fiona Ritchie explores new and traditional Celtic music in Europe and North America with interviews and conversations with singers, songwriters, and music experts. It is currently syndicated and can be heard on over 237 Member stations.\n\nRitchie, a native of Scotland, developed The Thistle & Shamrock show in 1981 at WFAE in Charlotte, North Carolina. It later debuted in June 1983 on radio stations across American Public Radio before moving to NPR in September 1990 as part of a collection of music shows and cultural programming. It has since become one of NPR\u2019s most widely heard and best-loved music programs. The show has evolved along with music technology and distribution\u2014 in the early days Ritchie sourced recordings from small independent record labels in the U.K., Ireland and North America using vinyl, reel-to-reel, CD, DAT, and mp3. The Thistle & Shamrock offered NPR\u2019s first free mp3 download in 2003.\n\n\u201cI am blessed to work in a way that doesn\u2019t feel job-like, so I\u2019m certainly not retiring, but it is time for a change. Although I want to bid farewell to weekly deadlines, it\u2019s not goodbye to listeners. I hope to connect in a different way, including curating archives and producing special programs for NPR. Watch this space!\n\nMaking radio means always being focused on what\u2019s ahead. Now looking over my shoulder, I estimate having shared 30,000 music tracks on air, hosted more than 400 guests and 200 live performances, and traveled in conjunction with \u2018Thistle\u2019 to 70 towns and cities across the U.S. Today my passion for public radio is undimmed, and I\u2019m forever a dedicated listener.\n\nI was really young when a radio station opened their doors to me, and I first connected with NPR listeners. How many young women are waiting for an opportunity to share their worlds and find their audiences in today\u2019s vast and complex media landscape? We need to create chances for the next generation of music hosts, and allow diverse young voices to claim a space on these precious airwaves, just as I did. Let\u2019s find them, encourage them, and hear them!\u201d said Ritchie.\n\n\u201cThe history of NPR is defined by shows like The Thistle & Shamrock,\u201d said Keith Jenkins, NPR\u2019s Vice President of Visuals and Strategy. \u201cThe sense of wonder, joy and discovery that Fiona\u2019s show brought to listeners for over 40 years is irreplaceable but we are eternally grateful we\u2019ve all been able to take this musical journey with her.\u201d\n\nRitchie and the program have been recognized with numerous awards and honors over four decades. Ritchie's awards include six World Medals from the New York Festivals' International Competition for Radio Programming, and a Flora Macdonald award from St. Andrews University (NC), which also conferred upon her the degree of honorary doctorate. She is also a 2018 Folk Radio Hall of Fame inductee and a 2016 Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame inductee. In 2014, Ritchie was named in the late Queen Elizabeth II's Birthday Honors List.\n\nThe Thistle & Shamrock was part of NPR\u2019s Cultural Programming Division when it was awarded the 2000 National Medal of Arts. Hundreds of Thistle & Shamrock tapes and vinyl albums, along with concert recordings, playlists, newsletters, and related materials are now part of a working archive in the Scottish Heritage Center at St. Andrews University (NC).\n\nFans of the show can hear new weekly episodes on their local Member station and the NPR app until September 30. Upcoming seasonal specials and archive episodes will be available on the NPR app with additional special archive content to be announced.\n\n###\n\nAbout NPR\n\nNPR's rigorous reporting and unsurpassed storytelling connects with millions of Americans every day \u2014 on the air, online, and in person.
