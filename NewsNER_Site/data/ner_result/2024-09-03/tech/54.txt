should	O
be	O
using	O
"a	O
shot	O
glass	O
full	O
of	O
sunscreen	O
for	O
the	O

Dr.	O
Ida	O
Orengo,	O
and	O
about	O
a	O
teaspoon	O

sunscreen	O
on	O
your	O

One	O
mistake	O
many	O

little.	O
Focus	O
less	O
on	O
the	O
SPF	O
(SPF	O
30	O
is	O
sufficient	O
—	O
as	O
we	O
go	O
up	O
in	O
SPF,	O
you're	O
really	O
getting	O
a	O

house	O
to	O
upgrade	O
first,	O
start	O

"That's	O
where	O
the	O

is	O
greatest.	O
There's	O
no	O
point	O
in	O
creating	O
a	O
cute	O
shelf	O
in	O
the	O
kitchen	O
when	O
every	O
time	O
you	O
walk	O

disabled	O
people,	O
do	O
not	O

"handi-capable"	O

that	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
demonstrate	O
our	O
acceptance	O
or	O
rejection	O
of	O
a	O
person's	O
identity."	O

4.	O
If	O
you	O
find	O
out	O
your	O
partner	O
is	O
having	O
an	O
affair,	O
your	O
first	O
instinct	O
might	O
be	O
to	O
kick	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
household.	O
But	O
that's	O
not	O
a	O
good	O
idea,	O
says	O
clinical	O
psychologist	O
Talal	O
Alsaleem.	O
While	O
it	O
seems	O
counterintuitive,	O
"it's	O
important	O
for	O
the	O
couple	O
to	O
stay	O
under	O
the	O
same	O
roof	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
[it's]	O
safe.	O
You	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
wondering	O
what's	O
going	O
on	O
with	O
the	O
unfaithful.	O
And	O
the	O
betrayed	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
isolated	O
in	O
the	O
trauma	O
of	O
discovery."	O
5.	O
Not	O
sure	O
how	O
you	O
and	O
your	O
partner	O
should	O
merge	O
your	O
money?	O
Try	O
a	O
joint	O
bank	O
account.	O
One	O
large-scale	O
study	O
from	O
2023	O
found	O
that	O
couples	O
who	O
put	O
all	O
their	O
money	O
into	O
one	O
pot	O
tended	O
to	O
be	O
happier.	O
They	O
stayed	O
together	O
longerthan	O
those	O
who	O
kept	O
some	O

all	O
of	O
their	O

separate.	O

parent's	O
past,	O
but	O

a	O
breakup.	O
These	O
moments	O

you	O
better	O

with	O
a	O
parent.	O
You’ll	O

wiser	O

more	O
sensitive	O
questions,	O
thanks	O
to	O
your	O

7.	O
If	O
your	O
friends	O
want	O
to	O
split	O
the	O
bill	O
evenly	O
at	O
a	O
restaurant,	O
but	O
you	O
didn't	O
order	O
as	O
many	O
drinks	O
as	O
they	O
did,	O
don't	O
just	O
stand	O
there	O
—	O
say	O
something.	O
"Just	O
be	O
like,	O
'Hey	O
guys	O
—	O
I	O
didn't	O
drink.'	O
Usually,	O
that's	O
enough	O
for	O
everyone	O
to	O
reconfigure	O
the	O
bill	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
fairer.	O
The	O
problems	O
only	O
arise	O
when	O

speak	O
up,"	O

you	O
are	O
a	O
new	O
parent	O
and	O
don't	O

words	O
of	O
affirmation	O

open	O
a	O
“pathway	O
for	O
intimacy	O
and	O
connection,"	O

The	O
postpartum	O

self-doubt.	O
So	O
tell	O
your	O
partner,	O
“Wow,	O
you’re	O
really	O
rocking	O
this,"	O
as	O
they're	O
caring	O
for	O
the	O
baby.	O
When	O
you	O
feel	O
supported	O
by	O
your	O
partner	O
—	O
rather	O
than	O
scolded	O
or	O
second-guessed	O
—	O
it’s	O
easier	O
to	O
initiate	O
romantic	O
interactions.	O
