Singing	O
is	O

it	O
takes	O
practice	O
and	O
time	O
to	O

Here's	O
how	O
to	O
start.	O
Stretch	O
your	O
speaking	O
voice	O
to	O
your	O
singing	O
voice	O
Singing	O
isn't	O
that	O
far	O
off	O
from	O
speaking,	O
says	O
Robinson-Martin.	B-PER
There	O

a	O
few	O
exercises	O
that	O
can	O
help	O
you	O
make	O
the	O
transition	O
from	O
your	O
speaking	O
voice	O
to	O
your	O
singing	O
voice.	O

three	O
warm-up	O
exercises	O

Use	O
apps	O
like	O
Pocket	O
Pitch	O
or	O

to	O
find	O
your	O
natural	O
voice.	O
Play	O
a	O
note	O
and	O
try	O
to	O
hum	O
or	O
match	O
it.	O
You	O
could	O
also	O
use	O
a	O
piano	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
access	O
to	O
one.	O
You	O
can	O
also	O
try	O
this	O
YouTube	O
tutorial	O
from	O
Ramsey	O
Voice	O
Studio.	O
Speak	O
a	O
phrase	O
and	O
start	O
to	O
elongate	O
it.	O
Make	O
it	O
a	O
positive	O
affirmation,	O
like,	O
"My	O
voice	O
is	O
strong!"	O
for	O
the	O
extra	O
bonus	O
of	O
hearing	O
some	O
encouragement.	O
As	O
you	O
repeat	O
the	O
phrase,	O
introduce	O
excitement	O
into	O
your	O
speech	O
–	O
that'll	O
help	O
you	O
more	O
naturally	O
slide	O
into	O
singing.	O
Practice	O
scales	O
to	O
hear	O
how	O
high	O
and	O
how	O
low	O
you	O
can	O
go.	O
Start	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
your	O
range	O
instead	O
of	O
the	O
bottom	O
because	O
if	O
you	O
start	O
at	O
the	O
bottom,	O
"you'll	O
hit	O
that	O
ceiling,	O
and	O
you	O
won't	O
get	O
past	O
it,"	O
says	O
says	O
Joanne	O
Rutkowski,	O

Focus	O
on	O
your	O
breath	O
The	O
way	O
you	O
breathe	O
is	O
crucial	O
to	O
finding	O
your	O
singing	O
voice,	O
says	O
Rutkowski.	O
As	O
you	O
inhale,	O
feel	O
the	O
air	O
fill	O
your	O
lungs	O
and	O
go	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
your	O
belly.	O
This	O
allows	O
your	O
breath	O
to	O
fill	O
your	O
diaphragm,	O
a	O
muscle	O
between	O
your	O
lungs	O
and	O
stomach,	O
and	O
give	O
your	O
voice	O
power.	O
Then	O
"push	O
that	O
air	O
out	O
from	O
your	O
belly,	O
up	O
out	O
through	O
your	O
lungs,	O
out	O
to	O

Find	O
your	O
own	O
singing	O
style	O
You	O
may	O
dream	O
about	O
sounding	O
like	O
your	O
favorite	O
artist,	O
but	O
your	O
voices	O
might	O
just	O
be	O
different.	O
So	O
instead,	O
work	O
in	O
a	O
vocal	O
range	O
that	O
suits	O
your	O
voice.	O
Once	O
you	O
have	O
that	O
awareness,	O
Robinson-Martin	O
says	O
"you	O
can	O
start	O
listening	O
for	O
other	O
singers	O
that	O
are	O
out	O
there	O
that	O
have	O
that	O
same	O
sound."	O
Just	O
be	O
wary	O
of	O
copying,	O
