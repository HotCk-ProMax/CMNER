wrapping	O
up	O
dinner	O
at	O
a	O

as	O
Marchand	O
was	O
about	O
to	O

was	O
in	O

I	O

to	O
get	O
the	O

then	O
I	O
realized	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
huddled	O
around	O
a	O
phone	O
back	O
by	O
the	O
kitchen	O
to	O
watch	O
Marchand.	O
"That's	O

on	O

a	O

in	O
a	O

two	O

bronze	O
medals,	O
in	O
the	O
5,000	O
meters	O
and	O
10,000	O
meters	O
earlier	O
in	O

“When	O
are	O
they	O
going	O
to	O
break	O
me,”	O
Hassan	O
said	O
she	O
wondered	O
of	O
her	O
competitors.	O
“They’re	O
going	O
to	O
go	O
hard.”	O
They	O
went	O
hard,	O

so	O
did	O
she,	O
deploying	O
a	O
strong	O
late	O
kick	O
in	O
the	O
closing	O
meters	O
of	O
the	O
race.	O
Ultimately,	O
she	O
set	O
an	O
Olympic	O
record	O
time	O
of	O
2	O
hours,	O
22	O
minutes,	O
55	O
seconds,	O
on	O
a	O
course	O
that	O
included	O
some	O
ferocious	O
hills.	O
“I	O
am	O
the	O
Olympic	O
champion,”	O

said	O
she	O

to	O
herself.	O

is	O
