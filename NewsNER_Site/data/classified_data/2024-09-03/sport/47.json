Here's how to share the load\n\ntoggle caption Photo illustration by Becky Harlan/NPR\n\nBefore having kids, many couples have a general sense of how they split their household chores. Maybe one partner cooks dinner and walks the dog, maybe the other cleans up and runs errands.\n\nBut how does that allocation change when a baby comes along? Who warms the bottles, changes the diapers or shushes baby back to sleep?\n\nThat\u2019s what couples coach Aaron Steinberg helps expecting parents figure out. \u201cThe division of roles and responsibilities is the biggest difficulty that parents face\u201d when bringing home a new baby, he says.\n\nWhat often happens is that both parents feel like they\u2019re taking on too many tasks, he says. And that can lead to resentment -- on top of the stress of taking care of a newborn.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTo prevent this from happening, says Steinberg, couples should have a conversation about how to manage household and child care duties well before Tiny arrives. He and relationship scientist and perinatal therapist Shy Porter offer tips on how to create a fair workload in the postpartum period.\n\n\n\nWrite down all your chores\n\nIn order to split the domestic workload fairly , you and your partner need to understand what the workload entails, says Steinberg. So sit down together and write out a list of all your household chores, including any anticipated child care duties.\n\nThe list should include:\n\nDaily chores like laundry and dishes\n\nlike laundry and dishes Less visible labor like meal planning and scheduling doctor\u2019s appointments\n\nlike meal planning and scheduling doctor\u2019s appointments Big projects leading up to baby\u2019s arrival , like setting up the nursery or putting together the stroller\n\n, like setting up the nursery or putting together the stroller Everyday tasks for baby , like washing baby bottles and changing diapers\n\n, like washing baby bottles and changing diapers Baby-related \u201clife admin\u201d tasks, like dealing with the hospital bill or ordering the baby\u2019s birth certificate\n\nDiscuss the burden of each task and assign duties\n\nOnce you and your partner have made your list, talk through which \u201cchores you are willing and able to take on\u201d after the baby arrives, says Porter.\n\nGet as granular as possible, she says. \u201cDo we both go to the pediatric appointments? What happens if the baby is sick at day care, who leaves work?\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTo create a sense of fairness in the assignments, keep these pointers in mind.\n\n\n\nResist the urge to assign all baby-related tasks to the birthing parent. It\u2019s a common excuse to say that a baby \u201cprefers\u201d one parent over another, or that one parent \u201cis just better\u201d at soothing the baby, says Steinberg. Parenting is new and scary for both parents, and both should be responsible for the basic tasks required in the newborn phase.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a common excuse to say that a baby \u201cprefers\u201d one parent over another, or that one parent \u201cis just better\u201d at soothing the baby, says Steinberg. Parenting is new and scary for both parents, and both should be responsible for the basic tasks required in the newborn phase. Play to your strengths. For example, if you\u2019ve always been the person in your relationship who\u2019s excited about cooking, take on meal prep and let your partner do the dishes.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you\u2019ve always been the person in your relationship who\u2019s excited about cooking, take on meal prep and let your partner do the dishes. Consider the weight of each task . \u201cDifferent people have different things they overthink,\u201d says Steinberg. For some people, buying a car seat might seem like a simple task. You find one at a fair price at a store you trust and buy it. Others may see it as a project that requires more careful research on safety ratings, prices and warranty periods. If you\u2019re feeling weighed down by a particular task, discuss it with your partner. You might consider swapping tasks or tackling the activity together.\n\n\n\n. \u201cDifferent people have different things they overthink,\u201d says Steinberg.

If you\u2019re feeling weighed down by a particular task, discuss it with your partner. You might consider swapping tasks or tackling the activity together. Don\u2019t try to split chores 50-50. In some instances, the load may be inherently imbalanced, says Porter. For example, if the baby is breastfed, the duty of feeding the baby will fall onto the birthing partner. Work with your partner to see where you might offset that burden. \u201cIf I'm up breastfeeding multiple times a night, maybe you are on diaper duty,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nIn some instances, the load may be inherently imbalanced, says Porter.

Work with your partner to see where you might offset that burden. \u201cIf I'm up breastfeeding multiple times a night, maybe you are on diaper duty,\u201d she says. Do the work. Remember, you and your partner are a team -- and your partner is depending on you to fulfill your assigned duties.\n\nKeep the plan flexible\n\nOnce the baby arrives, get ready for your chore assignments to change, says Steinberg. \u201cOne mistake people make is [assigning tasks then] never talking about it again.\u201d That\u2019s how hard feelings build up.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSo put a regular time on the calendar to talk about how things are going with your partner -- and make any changes as needed, he suggests.\n\nYou may need to adjust your chore chart for work schedules, baby\u2019s needs or just your preferences. A birthing parent who doesn\u2019t normally walk the dog, for example, might want to take on the task because they crave fresh air. Or maybe your baby switched to formula, allowing the non-birthing partner to take on a bigger role in feeding.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t keep score\n\nAside from being impractical, nickeling-and-diming individual duties is a quick road to disgruntlement and anger, says Steinberg. You don\u2019t want your relationship to get to a point where you\u2019re timing the length of each other\u2019s showers or counting how many times you changed diapers.\n\nInstead, put down any assumptions about your partner\u2019s workload and help out where you can. If your partner hasn\u2019t gotten to their task of doing the laundry yet, but they\u2019re dealing with the crying baby and you\u2019ve got a free moment, go ahead and stuff the clothes in the washer. It all comes out in the wash, says Steinberg.\n\nAsk for outside help\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky enough to have access to outside resources like friends, family or paid child care, don\u2019t forget to include them in your plan. Here are a few ways they can get involved.\n\n\n\nHave them help with child care. Porter worked with a couple who had relatives nearby who were willing to care for their baby. So the couple put their family members on a rotation schedule. Any time they needed an extra hand, they \u201cdidn\u2019t even have to think about it. They just referred to the sheet and gave someone a call,\u201d says Porter.\n\n\n\nPorter worked with a couple who had relatives nearby who were willing to care for their baby.

Strike grocery shopping and cooking off your task list in the early postpartum period by letting friends and family deliver homemade or take-out meals to you.

New parents sometimes find themselves surprisingly isolated in the postpartum period, says Porter. Well-intentioned friends and family might not reach out for worry that they\u2019re bothering you. So ask them to check in on you.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nCaring for a baby is a team sport, says Steinberg \u2014 and maintaining that spirit of teamwork throughout those early parenthood days \u201cis the thing that gets you through any other thing.\"\n\nThe digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib.
