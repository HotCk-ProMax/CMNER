PRESIDENT	O
KAMALA	O
HARRIS:	O
The	O
most	O
important	O
and	O
most	O
significant	O
aspect	O
of	O
my	O
policy	O
perspective	O
and	O
decisions	O
is	O
my	O
values	O
have	O
not	O
changed.	O
INSKEEP:	O
With	O
Dana	O
Bash,	O
she	O
worked	O
through	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
policy	O
changes.	O
Running	O
for	O
president	O
in	O
2019,	O
she	O
said	O
she	O
would	O
ban	O
fracking.	O
But	O
in	O
the	O
interview,	O
she	O
insisted	O
she	O
had	O
changed	O
her	O
mind	O
by	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
later	O
in	O
that	O
same	O
campaign	O
in	O
2020	O
-	O
that	O
she's	O
been	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
fracking	O
for	O
years	O
and	O
would	O
not	O
ban	O
it	O
now.	O
Republicans	O
had	O
criticized	O
Harris	O
for	O
avoiding	O
interviews	O
up	O
to	O
now,	O
which	O
raised	O
the	O
stakes	O
on	O
this	O
one.	O
MARTIN:	O
NPR's	O
Asma	O
Khalid	O
watched	O
the	O
interview,	O
and	O
she	O
is	O
with	O
us	O
now.	O
Good	O
morning,	O
Asma.	O
ASMA	O
KHALID,	O
BYLINE:	O
Good	O
morning.	O
MARTIN:	O
And	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
mention	O
here	O
that	O
you've	O
also	O
interviewed	O
Kamala	O
Harris	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
times,	O
and	O
you've	O
been	O
covering	O
her.	O
What	O
was	O
your	O
major	O
takeaway?	O
KHALID:	O
Well,	O
I	O
think	O
you	O
see	O
in	O
this	O
interview	O
that	O
she	O
has	O
grown.	O
I	O
mean,	O
she	O
is	O
certainly	O
more	O
practiced	O
in	O
how	O
to	O
interview	O
-	O
in	O
how	O
to	O
answer,	O
I'm	O
sorry,	O
reporter	O
questions	O
than	O
when	O
I	O
first	O
interviewed	O
her,	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
also	O
a	O
different	O
format.	O
It	O
was	O
a	O
joint	O
interview	O
with	O
her	O
running	O
mate,	O
Tim	O
Walz.	O
You	O
know,	O
broadly,	O
Michel,	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
an	O
earth-shattering	O
interview.	O
Republicans	O
and	O
Democrats	O
will	O
take	O
from	O
it	O
whatever	O
they	O
want	O
that	O
reinforces	O
their	O
own	O
preexisting	O
perceptions	O
of	O
her.	O
To	O
some,	O
she	O
is	O
seen	O
as	O
pragmatic.	O
To	O
others,	O
she's	O
long-winded.	O
And	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
could	O
take	O
whatever	O
they	O
want	O
either	O
way	O
in	O
that	O
interpretation	O
from	O
last	O
night's	O
interview.	O
You	O
know,	O
she	O
was	O
largely	O
offering	O
a	O
continuation	O
of	O
President	O
Biden's	O
policies.	O
One	O
area	O
that	O
caught	O
my	O
attention	O
was	O
the	O
economy,	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Democrats'	O
biggest	O
vulnerabilities.	O
Many	O
voters	O
remain	O
frustrated	O
with	O
high	O
prices.	O
She	O
acknowledged	O
that,	O
but	O
also	O
championed	O
the	O
work	O
that	O
the	O
Biden	O
administration	O
has	O
done	O
on	O
things	O
like	O
lowering	O
Medicare	O
drug	O
prices	O
and	O
creating	O
manufacturing	O
jobs.	O
(SOUNDBITE	O
OF	O
ARCHIVED	O
RECORDING)	O
HARRIS:	O
What	O
we	O
have	O
done	O
to	O
improve	O
the	O
supply	O
chain	O
so	O
we're	O
not	O
relying	O
on	O
foreign	O
governments	O
to	O
supply	O
American	O
families	O
with	O
their	O
basic	O
needs	O
-	O
I'll	O
say	O
that	O
that's	O
good	O
work.	O
There's	O
more	O
to	O
do,	O
but	O
that's	O
good	O
work.	O
MARTIN:	O
Did	O
she	O
offer	O
any,	O
say,	O
new	O
proposals	O
that	O
one	O
could	O
point	O
to	O
as	O
her	O
own?	O
KHALID:	O
Not	O
much.	O
I	O
mean,	O
she	O
was	O
asked	O
to	O
spell	O
out	O
about	O
what	O
she	O
would	O
do	O
on	O
Day	O
1	O
as	O
president,	O
and	O
she	O
talked	O
in	O
vague	O
terms	O
about	O
strengthening	O
the	O
middle	O
class.	O
But,	O
you	O
know,	O
I'd	O
also	O
say	O
that	O
detailed	O
policy	O
proposals	O
are	O
not	O
central	O
to	O
how	O
she's	O
campaigning.	O
She	O
talks	O
about	O
herself	O
as	O
being	O
a	O
new	O
way	O
forward	O
and	O
turning	O
the	O
page	O
on	O
an	O
era	O
of	O
negative	O
politics	O
that	O
has	O
dominated	O
our	O
culture	O
this	O
last	O
decade.	O
(SOUNDBITE	O
OF	O
ARCHIVED	O
RECORDING)	O
HARRIS:	O
Where	O
there	O
is	O
some	O
suggestion	O
-	O
warped,	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
-	O
that	O
the	O
measure	O
of	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
a	O
leader	O
is	O
based	O
on	O
who	O
you	O
beat	O
down,	O
instead	O
of	O
where	O
I	O
believe	O
most	O
Americans	O
are,	O
which	O
is	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
true	O
measure	O
of	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
a	O
leader	O
is	O
based	O
on	O
who	O
you	O
lift	O
up	O
-	O
that's	O
what's	O
at	O
stake,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
any	O
other	O
detail	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
discuss	O
in	O
this	O
election.	O
KHALID:	O
So	O
as	O
you	O
hear	O
there,	O
I	O
mean,	O
she	O
sees	O
this	O
campaign	O
about	O
character.	O
MARTIN:	O
I	O
mean,	O
it	O
sounds,	O
obviously,	O
like	O
she	O
was	O
alluding	O
to	O
former	O
President	O
Trump.	O
Did	O
she	O
have	O
more	O
to	O
say	O
about	O
her	O
Republican	O
opponent?	O
KHALID:	O
Well,	O
she	O
critiqued	O
his	O
time	O
in	O
office	O
and	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
mismanaged	O
the	O
COVID	O
crisis.	O
But	O
when	O
she	O
was	O
asked	O
to	O
respond	O
to	O
disparaging	O
comments	O
about	O
her	O
racial	O
identity,	O
she	O
brushed	O
off	O
the	O
question,	O
saying,	O
quote,	O
"Same	O
old	O
tired	O
playbook.	O
Next	O
question,	O
please."	O
You	O
know,	O
it	O
strikes	O
me	O
that	O
in	O
this	O
race	O
to	O
define	O
her,	O
she	O
does	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
play	O
on	O
Trump's	O
terms.	O
What's	O
interesting	O
is	O
that	O
she	O
and	O
Trump	O
have	O
never	O
really	O
interacted	O
in	O
person	O
before.	O
They're	O
expected	O
to	O
meet	O
on	O
the	O
debate	O
stage	O
September	O
10,	O
and	O
that	O
will	O
perhaps	O
be,	O
I	O
think,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
moments	O
of	O
this	O
truncated	O
campaign	O
-	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
they	O
respond	O
to	O
questions	O
face-to-face,	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
one	O
another	O
and	O
to	O
one	O
another.	O
MARTIN:	O
