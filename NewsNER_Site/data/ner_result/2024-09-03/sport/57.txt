Congratulations!	O
You’re	O
parents	O
now!	O
How’s	O
your	O
sex	O
life?	O
Chances	O
are,	O
not	O
so	O
hot.	O
Between	O
endless	O
diaper	O
changes,	O
sleep	O
deprivation,	O
hormonal	O
changes	O
and	O
general	O
exhaustion,	O
new	O
parents	O
don’t	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
or	O
energy	O
for	O
physical	O
intimacy.	O
And	O
even	O
though	O
many	O
doctors	O
give	O
the	O
birthing	O
partner	O
the	O
all-clear	O
to	O
have	O
sex	O
four	O
to	O
six	O
weeks	O
after	O
giving	O
birth,	O
many	O
may	O
not	O
feel	O
ready.	O
That	O
doesn’t	O
mean	O
you	O
can’t	O
show	O
love	O
in	O
other	O
ways,	O
says	O
Aaron	O
Steinberg,	O
a	O
couples	O
coach	O
who	O
teaches	O
expecting	O
parents	O
how	O
to	O
“babyproof”	O
their	O
relationships.	O
Kissing,	O
cuddling	O
and	O
even	O
words	O
of	O
affirmation	O
can	O
“cultivate	O
and	O
nurture	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
your	O
relationship	O
that	O
makes	O
you	O
more	O
than	O

Stress	O
and	O
monotony	O
in	O
new	O
parenthood	O
may	O
foster	O
resentment	O
or	O
pull	O
couples	O
apart.	O
But	O
parents	O
who	O
practice	O
intimacy,	O
he	O
says,	O
may	O
emerge	O
from	O
this	O
stage	O
feeling	O
“more	O
in	O
love,	O
more	O
on	O
a	O
team	O
and	O
even	O
more	O
attracted	O
to	O
each	O
other.”	O
Relationship	O
experts	O
explain	O
how	O
to	O
keep	O
romance	O
alive	O
in	O
the	O
postpartum	O
period.	O
It	O
will	O
take	O
effort	O
and	O
creativity	O
to	O
stay	O
connected	O
—	O
but	O
the	O
benefit	O
is	O
worth	O
it,	O
says	O
Steinberg.	O
1.	O
Expand	O
your	O
idea	O
of	O
intimacy	O
We	O
often	O
think	O
of	O
sex	O
and	O
intimacy	O
as	O
having	O
a	O
singular,	O
binary	O
goal,	O
says	O
Steinberg:	O
orgasm.	O
But	O
sex	O
isn’t	O
always	O
an	O
option	O
or	O
always	O
desired,	O
so	O
it’s	O
important	O
to	O
broaden	O
our	O
idea	O
of	O
intimacy.	O
Don’t	O
assume	O
that	O
every	O
act	O
of	O
foreplay	O
needs	O
to	O
lead	O
to	O
sex,	O
he	O
says.	O
“Can	O
you	O
feel	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
hand-holding,	O
cuddling	O
or	O
kissing	O
without	O
it	O
needing	O
to	O
go	O
anywhere?”	O
And	O
if	O
you’re	O
craving	O
something	O
more,	O
find	O
other	O
ways	O
to	O
satisfy	O
that	O
desire.	O
Remember,	O
sex	O
is	O
wide-ranging,	O
says	O
relationship	O
scientist	O
and	O
perinatal	O
therapist	O
Shy	O
Porter.	O
Sensual	O
touching	O
(like	O
massages	O
and	O
back	O
rubs),	O
mutual	O
masturbation	O
or	O
oral	O
sex	O
might	O
be	O
more	O
comfortable	O
than	O
penetrative	O
sex	O
in	O
the	O
postpartum	O
period.	O

and	O
that’s	O

These	O

You	O
don’t	O
have	O
to	O

it’s	O

“us”	O

on	O

says	O

Maybe	O
it’s	O
for	O

it’s	O

after	O
baby	O
goes	O

Scheduling	O
moments	O
for	O
intimacy	O
can	O
give	O
couples	O
something	O
to	O
look	O
forward	O
to	O
and	O
create	O
a	O
necessary,	O
sacred	O
space	O
free	O
from	O
baby	O
or	O
logistics	O
talk,	O
says	O
Porter.	O
“Pre-baby,	O
cuddling	O
once	O
a	O
week	O
might	O
seem	O
like	O
not	O
a	O
big	O
deal,	O
but	O
when	O
you're	O
in	O
this	O
new	O
phase	O
of	O
your	O
life,	O
it	O
feels	O
tremendous	O
and	O
so	O
good.”	O
5.	O
Don’t	O
make	O
your	O
partner	O
guess	O
what	O
you	O
want	O
During	O
the	O
postpartum	O
period,	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
dealing	O
with	O
big	O
changes	O
to	O
your	O
body	O
and	O
identity.	O
And	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
difficult	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
intimacy	O
you	O
need	O
from	O
your	O
partner	O
at	O
this	O
time.	O
“Asking	O
your	O
partner	O
to	O
guess	O
what	O
you	O
want	O
while	O
also	O
trying	O
to	O
guess	O
what	O
they	O
want	O
is	O
a	O
tall	O
order,”	O
she	O
says.	O
“Closing	O
that	O
gap	O
requires	O
educating	O
yourself.”	O
So	O
take	O
the	O
time	O
to	O
identify	O
your	O
turn-ons,	O
says	O
Boodram,	O
whether	O
that’s	O
dirty	O
talk,	O
sensual	O
massages	O
or	O
visual	O
triggers.	O
“What	O
is	O
the	O
specific	O
thing	O
you	O
require	O
that	O
turns	O
you	O
from	O
a	O
state	O

Then	O
