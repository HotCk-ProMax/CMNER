Recent headlines remind us they can also be a serious health concern.\n\nIn New England, cases of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) \u2014 a rare but potentially deadly disease \u2014 have shut down some public parks and killed one person in New Hampshire. Meanwhile, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s former top infectious disease expert, is recovering from West Nile virus, another mosquito-borne disease.\n\nResearchers say mosquito-borne illnesses are on the rise across the U.S., Central and South America and Europe, thanks to warming temperatures and other factors. And while West Nile virus remains the most common in the U.S., many other mosquito-borne illnesses \u2013 including Zika, malaria and dengue \u2013 are also a concern.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cLuckily for humans, you prevent them a lot the same way,\u201d says Dr. Angelle Desiree LaBeaud, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Stanford University and epidemiologist whose work focuses on insect-borne diseases.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about protecting yourself from a potentially infectious mosquito bite.\n\nCover Up\n\nA mosquito can\u2019t infect you if it can\u2019t bite you, and that means avoiding going outdoors when they are most active, from dusk until dawn. If you do go outside at these times, it\u2019s important to cover up with long pants and long sleeves so there\u2019s less exposed skin for mosquitos to nip at, says Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, Texas.\n\nEven though he\u2019s on the Gulf Coast, where summers can get brutally hot, Hotez says he makes sure to cover up completely whenever he ventures outside in the morning or evening.\n\n\u201cI am actually covered in a long-sleeve hoodie, sweat pants, socks and sneakers and a hat. And of course, people look at me like I'm crazy because it's so hot and everyone\u2019s in shorts.\u201d But it helps him avoid getting bitten.\n\nUse insect repellent\n\nHotez says he also applies insect repellent on whatever skin is left exposed \u2013 the back and palm of his hands, his neck and the sides of his face.\n\nThe CDC recommends using an insect-repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency, including DEET, picaridin and IR3535.\n\nOil of lemon eucalyptus and para-menthane-diol (PMD) also work, according to the CDC, but they should not be used on children under age 3.\n\nYou can also treat your clothes with an insect repellent called permethrin. Just don\u2019t get it on your skin. And cat owners should be careful when spraying, because permethrin is toxic to cats. The CDC has a video on how to use it properly.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to protect kids, too.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using insect repellent on kids, too, whenever you\u2019re in an area where bites are a concern.\n\nAnd while some parents are wary, the AAP says it's safe to use DEET on kids \u2013 just make sure to use a product that contains no more than 30% DEET, and only apply it once a day on a child.\n\nThe pediatricians\u2019 group recommends using insect repellents in the form of sticks, lotions and unpressurized sprays for kids, and avoiding products that combine insect repellent with sunscreen.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDon\u2019t spray kids\u2019 faces directly. Instead, the AAP says to put repellent on your own hands and then rub it on the child\u2019s face. And don\u2019t apply repellent to young kids\u2019 hands because they tend to put their hands in their mouth or eyes.\n\nAs with grownups, you can reduce the amount of insect repellent needed with kids by dressing them in long pants and sleeves. The CDC also recommends using mosquito netting to cover babies in strollers and baby carriers.\n\nMosquito nets are also good for adults, especially when sleeping outdoors.\n\nCheck your screens and get rid of standing water\n\nMosquitoes love to breed in standing water, so it\u2019s important to make sure to empty any containers \u2013 whether it be empty flower pots, kids\u2019 toy buckets or whatnot \u2013 that might attract them, LaBeaud and Hotez both say.\n\nThat goes for indoors too, Hotez says, especially if you\u2019re keeping the door open for a while to, say, let the dog out. And don\u2019t forget to check window and door screens for holes or snags that might let mosquitoes sneak inside.\n\nCall mosquito control\n\nIf you happen to see a lot of mosquito activity on your property and don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from, LaBeaud says you can call your local mosquito control district and they\u2019ll come out and investigate and help treat the problem.\n\nLaBeaud welcomes the recent attention to preventing mosquito bites, because as she notes, \u201cMosquitoes are not always harmless,\u201d they kill more people than any other creature in the world.\n\nStill, she says, she doesn\u2019t want people to be terrified \u2013 \u201cjust recognize that they could have a health impact,\u201d and take precautions.\n\nThis story was edited by Jane Greenhalgh",
