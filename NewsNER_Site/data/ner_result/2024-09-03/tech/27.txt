The	O
challenges	O
ahead	O
One	O
major	O
concern	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
vaccine	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
refrigerated	O
at	O
every	O
step	O
and	O
Gaza	O
has	O
no	O
electricity	O
—	O
just	O
generators	O
running	O
on	O
fuel	O
that’s	O
in	O
short	O
supply.	O
Another	O
challenge	O
is	O
that	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
population	O
in	O
Gaza	O
is	O
displaced	O
so	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
difficult	O
for	O
people	O
to	O
reach	O
U.N.-run	O
clinics.	O
But	O
the	O
aid	O
groups	O
in	O
charge	O
of	O
the	O
rollout	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
most	O
critical	O
factor	O
is	O
a	O
pause	O
in	O
airstrikes	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
reach	O
all	O
the	O
kids	O
in	O
Gaza.	O
The	O
U.N.	O
warned	O
that	O
without	O
the	O
pauses,	O
the	O
vaccine	O
rollout	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
possible.	O
The	O

cases	O
in	O
Gaza	O
The	O
first	O
case	O
of	O
polio	O
in	O
Gaza	O
in	O
a	O
quarter	O
century	O
was	O
confirmed	O
earlier	O
this	O
month	O
in	O
a	O
10-month-old	O
baby,	O
who	O
developed	O
paralysis	O
in	O
one	O
leg.	O
It	O
came	O
shortly	O
after	O
polio	O
was	O
detected	O
in	O
six	O
out	O
of	O
seven	O
routine	O

Message	O
There	O
are	O
at	O
least	O
two	O
other	O
suspected	O
cases,	O
but	O
doctors	O
monitoring	O
the	O
situation	O
estimate	O
that	O
thousands	O
of	O
people	O
in	O
Gaza	O
have	O
likely	O
already	O
contracted	O
polio.	O
That's	O
because	O
most	O
people	O
infected	O
with	O
polio	O
do	O
not	O
experience	O
symptoms	O
and	O
can	O
fight	O
it	O
off	O
on	O
their	O
own.	O
But	O
the	O
virus	O
is	O
highly	O
contagious,	O
and	O
it	O
can	O
spread	O
through	O
water	O
systems,	O
aquifers	O
and	O
in	O
droplets	O
in	O
the	O

World	O
health	O
officials	O
have	O

the	O

that	O

easily	O

Israel,	O

It	O

the	O
