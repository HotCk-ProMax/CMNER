was	O
teaching	O
a	O
workshop	O
on	O
financial	O
education	O
this	O
summer	O
when	O
a	O
member	O
of	O
the	O
building's	O
cleaning	O
staff	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
her.	O
"I	O
wanted	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
you,"	O
he	O
said.	O
"When	O
I	O
first	O
got	O
my	O
job,	O
the	O
[company]	O
offered	O
me	O
a	O
retirement	O
plan.	O
But	O
my	O
cousin	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
scam,	O
so	O
I	O
never	O
did	O
it.	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
mistake."	O
"My	O
heart	O
wanted	O
to	O
break,"	O
says	O
Espinal.	O
She	O
told	O
him:	O
"Your	O
cousin	O
did	O
not	O
serve	O
you	O
well.	O
It's	O
not	O
a	O
scam.	O
It's	O
a	O
benefit."	O
She	O
understood	O
how	O
the	O
disconnect	O
might	O
have	O
happened.	O
"He	O
was	O
an	O
older	O

those	O
from	O
underresourced	O

—	O
struggle	O
with	O
borrowing,	O
investing	O
and	O

She	O
then	O
teaches	O
them	O
how	O
to	O
make	O
better-informed	O
decisions	O
about	O
money.	O
Here	O
are	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
common	O
financial	O
mistakes	O
she	O
encounters	O
in	O
her	O
line	O
of	O
work.	O
Mistake	O
1:	O
Thinking	O
a	O
loan	O
is	O
free	O
money	O
If	O
you	O
need	O
money,	O
your	O
instinct	O
might	O
be	O
to	O
borrow	O
from	O
a	O
lender.	O
But	O
remember,	O
a	O
loan	O
is	O
not	O
free	O
money,	O
says	O
Espinal.	O
Those	O
lenders	O
are	O
"running	O
a	O
business	O
and	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
profit."	O
Some	O
of	O
"those	O
interest	O
rates	O
are	O
so	O
high	O
and	O
compound	O
so	O
quickly	O
that	O
the	O
amount	O
you're	O
paying	O
back	O
is	O
significantly	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
amount	O
you	O
borrowed.	O
It	O
can	O
trap	O
you	O
in	O
a	O
cycle	O
of	O
debt."	O
So	O
put	O
your	O
"business	O
hat	O
on	O
and	O
shop	O
around	O
for	O
the	O
best	O
deal,"	O
she	O
says.	O
You	O
may	O
feel	O
desperate,	O
but	O
don't	O
just	O
take	O
the	O
first	O
loan	O
you	O
can	O
get.	O
Go	O
online	O
and	O
look	O
up	O
the	O
terms	O
of	O
different	O
loans.	O
Or	O
go	O
to	O
a	O
credit	O
union,	O
which	O
will	O
often	O
have	O
better	O
interest	O
rates	O
on	O
loans.	O
Mistake	O
2:	O
Cosigning	O
loans	O
If	O
a	O
friend	O
or	O
relative	O
asks	O
you	O
to	O
cosign	O
a	O
loan,	O
don't	O
do	O
it,	O
says	O
Espinal.	O
Cosigning	O
a	O
loan	O
means	O
you're	O
agreeing	O
to	O
be	O
responsible	O
for	O
someone	O
else's	O
debt.	O
If	O
the	O
main	O
borrower	O
misses	O
payments,	O
you	O
must	O
repay	O
the	O
loan.	O
It	O
also	O
means	O
that	O
the	O
debt	O
is	O
on	O
your	O
credit	O
report,	O
which	O
could	O
prevent	O
you	O
from	O
getting	O
a	O
loan	O
or	O
could	O
make	O
a	O
loan	O
you	O
need	O
more	O
expensive.	O
If	O
you	O
find	O
it	O
hard	O
to	O
say	O
no	O
to	O
a	O
loved	O
one	O
who	O
needs	O
a	O
loan,	O
support	O
that	O
person	O
in	O
other	O
ways,	O
says	O
Espinal.	O
When	O
her	O
godsister	O
asked	O
her	O
to	O
cosign	O
a	O
loan,	O
Espinal	O
declined,	O
but	O
offered	O
to	O
help	O
her	O
find	O
a	O
loan	O
for	O
people	O
with	O
lower	O
credit	O
scores	O
and	O
to	O
look	O
over	O
her	O
credit	O

3:	O
Not	O
putting	O
your	O
money	O
in	O
a	O
high-yield	O
savings	O
account	O
If	O
your	O
cash	O
is	O
in	O
a	O
traditional	O
savings	O
account,	O
it's	O
probably	O
making	O
little,	O
if	O
any,	O
interest,	O
says	O

Rates	O

at	O

So	O
put	O
those	O
funds	O
in	O
a	O
high-yield	O
savings	O
account	O
with	O
interest	O
rates	O
between	O
about	O
4%	O
and	O
5%.	O
These	O
higher-interest	O
rates	O
allow	O
your	O
money	O
to	O
grow	O
and	O
protect	O
your	O
savings	O
against	O
inflation.	O
"The	O
banks	O

says	O
Espinal.	O
If	O
that	O
gives	O
you	O
pause,	O

this:	O
As	O

4:	O
Spending	O
more	O

more	O
Some	O

who	O
earn	O
hundreds	O
of	O
thousands	O
of	O
dollars	O
a	O
year	O
find	O
themselves	O
living	O
paycheck	O
to	O
paycheck.	O
That	O
can	O
happen	O
when	O
people	O
think	O
a	O
higher	O
income	O
means	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
live	O
a	O
lifestyle	O
that	O
matches	O
it,	O
says	O
Espinal.	O
It's	O
a	O
phenomenon	O
called	O
"lifestyle	O
creep"	O
or	O
"lifestyle	O
inflation."	O
"And	O
so	O
the	O
money	O
goes	O
into	O
financial	O

that	O
are	O
not	O
necessary:	O
a	O
new	O

a	O
new	O

think	O
we	O
deserve	O
it,"	O
she	O

you	O
also	O
deserve	O

have	O
a	O
dignified	O

be	O

generational	O

down	O
to	O
your	O
children."	O
If	O
you're	O
making	O
more	O
money,	O
your	O
savings	O
rate	O
should	O
also	O
increase.	O
Adjust	O
how	O
much	O
you	O
save	O
based	O
on	O
what	O
you	O
earn.	O
If	O
you	O

your	O
employer	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
direct	O
deposit	O
into	O
your	O
high-yield	O
savings	O

in	O
what's	O

right	O
now,	O
