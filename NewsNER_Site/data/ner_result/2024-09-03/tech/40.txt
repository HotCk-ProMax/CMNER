How	O
do	O
you	O
save	O
money	O
on	O
groceries?	O
Over	O
the	O
last	O
year,	O
grocery	O
prices	O
have	O
increased	O
by	O
1.1%.	O
But	O
that's	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
a	O
3.6%	O
increase	O
in	O
the	O
previous	O
year	O
and	O
a	O
whopping	O
13.1%	O
the	O
year	O
before	O
that,	O
according	O
to	O
reporting	O
from	O
NPR’s	O
Scott	O
Horsley.	O
Mayonnaise	O
prices,	O
for	O
example,	O
have	O
surged	O
43%	O
over	O
the	O
past	O
three	O
years,	O
according	O
to	O
global	O
research	O
firm	O

“What	O

“Not	O

Moncel.	O
“Sometimes	O

A	O

who	O
did	O
an	O
episode	O
on	O
shrinkflation:	O
pay	O
attention	O
to	O
unit	O

For	O
example,	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
trying	O
to	O
decide	O
whether	O
to	O
buy	O
that	O
“family	O
size”	O
box	O
of	O
Cocoa	O
Puffs,	O
the	O
“giant	O
size”	O
box	O
or	O
just	O
a	O
regular	O
box,	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
price	O

If	O
the	O
regular	O
box	O
has	O
a	O
lower	O
price	O
per	O

than	O
the	O

4.	O
Swap	O
out	O
pricey	O
ingredients	O
Meats	O
and	O
cheeses	O
will	O
often	O
cost	O
more	O
than	O
vegetables	O
or	O
grains,	O
says	O
Moncel.	O
But	O
cutting	O
back	O
doesn't	O
mean	O
going	O
without.	O
For	O
instance,	O
if	O
a	O
chili	O
recipe	O
calls	O
for	O
a	O
pound	O
of	O
ground	O
beef,	O
she	O
says	O
you	O
could	O
reduce	O
the	O
beef	O
by	O
half	O
and	O
then	O
bulk	O
up	O
the	O
recipe	O
with	O
less	O
expensive	O
ingredients	O
like	O
beans,	O
lentils,	O
or	O
rice.	O
That	O
way,	O
you'll	O
still	O
get	O
the	O
flavor	O
of	O
the	O
beef	O
without	O
the	O
cost.	O

That	O
includes	O
potatoes,	O
onions,	O

broccoli,	O
she	O
says.	O
She	O
loves	O
cooking	O

write	O
down	O

says	O
Moncel.	O
A	O
grocery	O

can	O

avoid	O
buying	O
nonessential	O
items	O
and	O
keep	O

7.	O

A	O

you	O
head	O
to	O
the	O
supermarket,	O
"take	O
your	O
shopping	O
list	O
into	O
the	O

and	O
double-check	O
whether	O
you	O
have	O
those	O
items.	O
You	O
might	O
not	O

you	O
already	O

some	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
on	O
hand,”	O
says	O
Moncel.	O
8.	O
Use	O
up	O
all	O
the	O
groceries	O
you	O
buy	O
For	O
leftovers,	O
rely	O
on	O
the	O
freezer,	O
says	O
Moncel.	O
"A	O
lot	O
more	O
foods	O
are	O
freezable	O
than	O
people	O
realize.	O
I	O
often	O
freeze	O
leftover	O
cheese.	O
Leftover	O
bread	O
products	O
also	O
freeze	O
well."	O
If	O
you	O
can't	O
freeze	O
what	O
you	O
have	O
left	O
over,	O
look	O
up	O
additional	O
recipes	O
with	O
those	O
ingredients	O
as	O
keywords.	O
For	O
example,	O
search	O
for	O
"recipes	O

Think	O
outside	O

You	O
may	O
be	O
