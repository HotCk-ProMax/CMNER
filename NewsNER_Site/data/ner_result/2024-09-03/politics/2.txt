a	O

The	O
outcome	O
of	O
Sunday's	O
elections	O
in	O
the	O
states	O
of	O
Thüringen	O
and	O
Saxony	O
has	O
political	O
observers	O
worried	O
about	O
a	O
resurgence	O
of	O
anti-immigrant,	O
nationalist,	O
populist	O
politics	O
in	O
Germany	O
and	O
Europe.	O
Here	O
are	O
five	O

the	O
elections:	O

nationalist,	O
anti-immigrant	O
politics	O
of	O

The	O
Alternative	O
for	O
Germany,	O
known	O
by	O
the	O
German	O
initials	O
AfD,	O
a	O
nationalist	O
party	O
that	O
routinely	O
blames	O
immigrants	O
for	O
many	O
of	O
Germany’s	O
problems,	O
has	O
been	O
around	O
for	O
11	O
years.	O
It	O
rose	O
in	O
prominence	O
six	O
years	O
ago	O
after	O
former	O
Chancellor	O
Angela	O
Merkel	O
allowed	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
million	O
migrants	O
from	O
war-torn	O
countries	O
in	O
the	O
Middle	O
East	O
to	O
resettle	O
in	O
Germany.	O

The	O
AfD	O
has	O
become	O
so	O
notorious	O
that	O
it’s	O
been	O
placed	O
under	O
domestic	O
surveillance	O
for	O
the	O
threat	O
that	O
it	O
poses	O
to	O
Germany’s	O
constitution.	O
Despite	O
this,	O
the	O
party	O
won	O
the	O
most	O
seats	O
in	O
the	O
election	O
in	O
Thüringen,	O
with	O
nearly	O
a	O
third	O
of	O
parliament	O
(32.8%),	O
and	O
it	O
nearly	O
won	O
the	O
most	O
seats	O
in	O

with	O
more	O
than	O
30%	O

Unchecked	O
migration	O
in	O
Germany	O
is	O
becoming	O
one	O
of	O
voters’	O
biggest	O
concerns.	O
German	O
voters	O
are	O
becoming	O
increasingly	O
frustrated	O
by	O
a	O
wave	O
of	O
migrants	O
arriving	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
in	O
recent	O
years,	O
especially	O
now	O
that	O
Germany’s	O
economy	O
has	O
stagnated.	O
This	O
frustration	O
peaked	O
last	O
month	O
when	O
a	O
Syrian	O
man	O
stabbed	O
to	O
death	O
three	O
people	O
and	O
injured	O
several	O
others	O
at	O
a	O
festival	O
in	O
the	O
western	O
German	O
city	O
of	O
Solingen.	O
After	O
the	O
attack,	O
it	O
was	O
discovered	O
that	O
the	O
man	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
deported	O
months	O
ago,	O
and	O
it	O
led	O
to	O
growing	O
anger	O
about	O
Germany’s	O
immigration	O
system.	O
3.	O
Despite	O
big	O
election	O
gains,	O
the	O
AfD	O
will	O
likely	O
be	O
kept	O
from	O
participating	O
in	O
either	O
states'	O
government.	O
That’s	O
because	O
every	O
other	O
party	O
in	O
Germany	O
has	O
refused	O

the	O
election	O
results	O
may	O
mean	O
for	O
next	O
year’s	O
federal	O
election	O
in	O
Germany	O
Perhaps	O
most	O
interesting	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
three	O
parties	O
in	O
power	O
on	O
a	O
national	O
level	O
—	O
the	O
Social	O
Democratic	O
Party,	O
the	O
Green	O
Party	O
and	O
the	O
libertarian	O
Free	O
Democratic	O
Party	O
—	O
all	O
suffered	O
big	O
losses	O
in	O
these	O
state	O
elections,	O
and	O
it	O
underscores	O
how	O
unpopular	O
they’ve	O
become	O
with	O
voters	O
not	O
only	O
in	O
the	O
former	O
East	O
Germany,	O
but	O
nationally	O
as	O
well.	O
It's	O
clear	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
national	O
election,	O
the	O
country	O
will	O
make	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
the	O
right.	O
That	O
will	O
mean	O
stricter	O
immigration	O
rules	O
and	O
a	O
bigger	O
focus	O
on	O
growing	O
Germany’s	O
stagnant	O
economy.	O
This	O
is	O
a	O
trend	O
playing	O
out	O
in	O
other	O
parts	O
of	O
Europe,	O
too	O
—	O
namely	O
France,	O
where	O
a	O
strong	O

right-wing	O
