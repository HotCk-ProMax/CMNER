    "text": "New England News Collaborative becomes NPR\u2019s fifth regional newsroom\n\nThursday, July 11, 2024 \u2014NPR is joining the New England News Collaborative to establish a regional newsroom that boosts their joint ability to deliver multimedia journalism that helps people engage more meaningfully in their communities.\n\nThe move builds on the success of the NENC, founded in 2015 with support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and NPR\u2019s four existing regional newsrooms. The regional newsroom model allows groups of stations to plan coverage together, share resources and dig into the most important stories in their regions \u2013 in close partnership with NPR. The NENC becomes the fifth regional newsroom, joining those in Texas, California, the Gulf States and the Midwest. The NENC is composed of 10 stations in six states from Connecticut to Maine: Connecticut Public, New Hampshire Public Radio, Vermont Public, Maine Public, GBH, WBUR, CAI Cape and Islands, New England Public Media in western Massachusetts, Rhode Island PBS & The Public\u2019s Radio, and WSHU in southern Connecticut.\n\n\u201cNPR is committed to deepening collaboration with our local stations to better serve the public\u2019s need for trustworthy reporting that\u2019s vital to our democracy,\u201d said Edith Chapin, NPR Senior Vice President, Editor in Chief and acting Chief Content Officer. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to work more closely with the New England News Collaborative on this crucial shared mission.\u201d\n\nNPR and the New England stations have already tested their new partnership, teaming up to bring readers and listeners both breaking news (October\u2019s mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine) and moments of joy (April\u2019s live coverage of the solar eclipse). Going forward, they plan to add a pilot project on visual journalism, funded by a grant from Eric and Wendy Schmidt, and to deliver ambitious reporting that would be hard for a single station or NPR to do on its own.\n\n\u201cThe New England News Collaborative partners have come together to share coverage of important issues in the Northeast, including climate change and the environment, health, racial equity, politics and the economy,\u201d said Mark G. Contreras, CEO and President of Connecticut Public, the lead station in the collaborative. \u201cAs an NPR regional newsroom, we can do even more.\u201d\n\nNENC Managing Editor Cori Princell will continue as the regional newsroom\u2019s day-to-day editorial leader, serving as a key liaison with NPR and coordinating regional coverage plans among all the participating stations and NPR.\n\n\u201cOur stations produce powerful and creative work across all platforms. We\u2019re excited to share more of that work across the country,\u201d said Princell.\n\n\u201cAs the former managing editor at New Hampshire Public Radio, Cori understands the impact local and regional reporting can have on our communities,\u201d said Vanessa de la Torre, who served as NENC\u2019s executive editor since 2020 and is now chief content officer at Connecticut Public, where she oversees the NENC\u2019s strategic goals. \u201cWorking with NPR as a regional newsroom gives us new opportunities to expand our impact.\u201d\n\nThe regional newsroom is supported by contributions from the partner organizations and a grant from Eric and Wendy Schmidt through the Schmidt Family Foundation. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a founding funder of the New England News Collaborative, which also receives support from foundations and donors.\n\nAbout NPR\n\nNPR's rigorous reporting and unsurpassed storytelling connects with millions of Americans every day \u2014 on the air, online, and in person.
