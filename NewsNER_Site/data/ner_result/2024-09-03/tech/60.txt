Generative	O

(GAI)	O
is	O
a	O
tool	O
that	O
may	O

us	O

as	O

Guideline:	O
You	O
are	O
responsible	O
for	O
the	O
content	O
you	O
create,	O
with	O
or	O
without	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
GAI.	O
Plagiarism	O
and	O
accuracy	O
are	O
major	O
concerns	O
with	O
GAI	O
which	O
scrapes	O
the	O
Internet	O
for	O
information	O
and	O
material,	O
and	O
uses	O
that	O
material	O
to	O
generate	O
seemingly	O
new	O
products.	O
We	O
should	O
always	O
assume	O
that	O
what	O
GAI	O
comes	O
up	O
with	O
is	O
not	O
original,	O
and	O
we	O
don't	O
know	O
to	O
what	O
extent	O
it	O
is	O
simply	O
plagiarizing.	O
If	O
you	O
use	O
GAI	O
to	O
help	O
you	O
with	O
your	O
work,	O
you	O
are	O
ultimately	O
responsible	O
for	O
the	O
content	O
of	O
that	O
work	O
and	O
that	O
includes	O
making	O
sure	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
plagiarizing.	O
We	O
must	O
also	O
check	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
the	O
information	O
GAI	O
delivers	O
is	O
accurate	O
and	O
reliably	O
sourced.	O
We	O
cannot	O
assume	O
that	O
the	O
information	O
it	O

is	O
correct.	O
As	O
technology	O
evolves	O
our	O
use	O
of	O
it	O
will	O
evolve	O
as	O
well,	O

our	O

of	O
the	O
standards	O
that	O
guide	O
all	O
of	O
our	O

Guideline:	O
Don't	O
rely	O
on	O
GAI	O
to	O
include	O
all	O
angles	O
of	O
a	O

GAI	O
doesn't	O

what	O
it	O

As	O
journalists	O
we	O
constantly	O
question	O
our	O
assumptions,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
being:	O
Have	O
we	O
included	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
viewpoints	O
and	O
aspects	O
of	O
the	O

we	O
are	O

We	O

responsibility	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
we	O
are	O
looking	O
at	O
every	O
issue	O
from	O
multiple	O
viewpoints.	O
If	O
you	O
are	O
using	O
GAI	O
as	O
a	O
reporting	O
tool	O
it	O
may	O
well	O
miss	O
important	O
aspects	O
of	O
a	O
story.	O
It's	O
important	O
that	O
you	O
be	O
aware	O
of	O
that	O
potential	O
shortcoming	O
throughout	O
any	O
reporting	O
process	O
that	O
includes	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
GAI.	O
Guideline:	O
GAI	O
can't	O
check	O
its	O
own	O
biases,	O
that's	O
your	O
job.	O
GAI	O
has	O
no	O
sense	O
of	O
ethics	O
or	O
morals.	O
Those	O
must	O
come	O
from	O
you;	O
the	O
user	O
and	O
you	O
will	O
be	O
expected	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
anything	O
you	O
produce	O
using	O
GAI	O
conforms	O
to	O
the	O
standards	O
laid	O
out	O
in	O
this	O
handbook.	O
GAI	O
may	O
seem	O
autonomous,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
product	O
of	O
human	O
beings.	O
As	O
such,	O
it	O
shares	O
and	O
can	O
exacerbate	O
the	O
biases	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
created	O
and	O
programmed	O
it	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
biases	O
of	O
the	O
material	O
that	O
was	O
used	O
to	O
train	O
it.	O
As	O
we	O
use	O
it	O
we	O
must	O
be	O
on	O
the	O
lookout	O
for	O
those	O
biases	O
just	O
as	O
we	O
always	O
must	O
look	O
out	O
for	O
our	O
own	O
biases,	O
those	O
of	O
our	O
sources	O
and	O
those	O
of	O
our	O
colleagues.	O
Guideline:	O
If	O
GAI	O
played	O
a	O
significant	O
role	O
in	O
your	O
reporting	O
you	O
should	O
share	O
that	O
fact	O
with	O
your	O
audience.	O
As	O
the	O
main	O
transparency	O
section	O
of	O
this	O
handbook	O
says,	O
"We	O
reveal	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
we	O
practically	O
can	O
about	O
how	O
we	O
discover	O
and	O
verify	O
the	O
facts	O
we	O
present."	O
As	O
we	O
do	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
aspects	O
of	O
our	O
journalism,	O
if	O
GAI	O
plays	O
a	O
significant	O
role	O
in	O
the	O
reporting	O
of	O
a	O
story	O
we	O
should	O
reveal	O
that	O
fact	O
to	O
our	O
audience.	O
If	O
you're	O
not	O
sure	O
whether	O
your	O
use	O
of	O
GAI	O
was	O
significant	O
enough	O
to	O
include	O
in	O
your	O

it	O
with	O
your	O
editor,	O
a	O

Guideline:	O
We	O
must	O
protect	O
our	O
own	O
work.	O
Because	O
GAI	O
systems	O
learn	O
from	O
data,	O
they	O
may	O
take	O
anything	O
we	O
put	O

add	O
it	O
to	O
their	O
knowledge	O
base.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
no	O
NPR	O
employee	O
should	O
ever	O
put	O
any	O
of	O
NPR's	O
intellectual	O
property	O
into	O
any	O
GAI	O
system	O
without	O
NPR's	O
prior	O
consent.	O
NPR's	O
intellectual	O
property	O
includes	O
everything	O
you	O
have	O
created	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
your	O

—	O
from	O
your	O

your	O

of	O
a	O

memos	O
about	O

Also,	O
keep	O
in	O

that,	O
under	O
current	O
law,	O
material	O
produced	O
by	O
GAI	O
cannot	O
be	O

While	O
the	O

have	O
yet	O
to	O
clarify	O
exactly	O
how	O
much	O
human	O
input	O
is	O
needed,	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
some	O
human-generated	O
content	O
for	O
something	O
to	O
be	O
copyrightable.	O
Facts	O
themselves	O
are	O
not	O
copyrightable	O
and	O
the	O
human	O
content	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
creative	O
—	O
more	O
than	O
simply	O
adding	O
facts	O
to	O
something	O
that	O
was	O
on	O
AI.	O
NPR	O
has	O
an	O
interest	O
in	O
ensuring	O
that	O
content	O
we	O
create	O
is	O
copyrightable,	O
so	O
if	O
you	O
wish	O
to	O
use	O
GAI	O
to	O
create	O
content,	O
please	O
consult	O
the	O
OGC	O
(Office	O
of	O
General	O
Counsel)	O
first	O
to	O
determine	O
how	O
NPR	O
can	O
best	O
protect	O
its	O
interests	O
in	O
such	O
instances.	O
Guideline:	O
GAI	O
when	O
used	O
correctly	O
can	O
help	O
us	O
be	O
better	O
journalists.	O
GAI	O
does,	O
however,	O
open	O
up	O
a	O
whole	O
realm	O
of	O
possibilities.	O
It	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
tool	O
for	O
some	O
tasks	O
that	O
are	O
"hard	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
easy	O
to	O
verify,"	O
such	O
as	O
finding	O
patterns	O
in	O
statistics	O
or	O
finding	O
synonyms.	O
In	O
these	O
early	O
days,	O
we	O
are	O
asking	O
those	O
who	O
use	O
GAI	O
to	O
help	O
in	O
editorial	O
work	O
to	O
get	O
prior	O
approval	O
from	O
the	O
Managing	O
Editor	O
for	O
Standards	O
and	O
Practices.	O
As	O
we	O
work	O
with	O
it,	O
we	O
will	O
become	O
more	O
familiar	O
with	O
what	O
it	O
can	O
and	O
cannot	O
be	O
used	O
for.	O
Our	O
review	O
policies	O
will	O
likely	O
change,	O
as	O
will	O
this	O
guidance.	O
There	O
will	O
no	O
doubt	O
be	O
other	O
media	O
that	O
attempt	O
to	O
use	O
GAI	O
to	O
generate	O
content.	O
We	O
may	O
soon	O
see	O
a	O
two-tiered	O
media	O
landscape	O
with	O
some	O
media	O
trying	O
to	O
use	O
GAI	O
to	O
replace	O
humans.	O
Other	O
media,	O
including	O
NPR,	O
are	O
choosing	O
to	O
keep	O
humans	O
firmly	O
in	O
control.	O
Keeping	O
that	O
control	O
will	O
mean	O
we	O
are	O
upholding	O
our	O
journalistic	O
standards	O
even	O
as	O
we	O
find	O
ways	O
of	O
incorporating	O
GAI	O
into	O
our	O
