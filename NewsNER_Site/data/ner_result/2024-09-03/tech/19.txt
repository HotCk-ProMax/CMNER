Here’s	O
what	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
know:	O
What	O
exactly	O
are	O
these	O
new	O
shots?	O
The	O
Pfizer-BioNTech	O
and	O
Moderna	O
vaccines	O
rely	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
mRNA	O
technology	O
as	O
the	O
earlier	O
versions	O
of	O
the	O
vaccine,	O
but	O
they	O
now	O
target	O
the	O
KP.2	O
variant	O
–	O
a	O
member	O
of	O
the	O
omicron	O
family	O
that	O
rose	O
to	O
prominence	O
over	O
the	O
summer.	O
The	O
Novavax	O
vaccine,	O
which	O
is	O
based	O
on	O
an	O
older	O
technology,	O
targets	O
an	O
earlier	O
strain	O
of	O
the	O
virus	O
called	O
JN.1.	O
As	O
many	O
of	O
us	O
know	O
by	O
now,	O
the	O
virus	O
continues	O
evolving	O
to	O
better	O
evade	O
our	O
immune	O
defense,	O
which	O
means	O
regularly	O
updating	O
the	O
vaccines	O
to	O
keep	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
latest	O
strain.	O
It	O
turns	O
out	O
the	O
KP.2	O
and	O
JN.1	O
variants	O
have	O
already	O
been	O
overtaken	O
by	O
newer	O
variants.	O
Because	O
those	O
are	O
also	O
descendants	O
of	O
omicron,	O
the	O
hope	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
new	O

are	O
close	O
enough	O
matches	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
still	O
boost	O
immunity	O

from	O

everyone	O

“Anyone	O
who	O
wants	O
to	O

Pennsylvania	O

Children's	O
Hospital	O
of	O

who	O

The	O

does	O
lessen	O
your	O

getting	O
a	O
mild	O

the	O
calculation	O
could	O
be	O
different	O
for	O
younger	O
people	O
who	O
may	O
have	O
enough	O

Marks	O

most	O
people	O

get	O
the	O

However,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
wise	O
to	O
hold	O
off	O
if	O
you	O
had	O
COVID-19	O
over	O
the	O

People	O
should	O
wait	O
at	O

two	O

three	O

since	O
their	O

or	O
their	O

the	O
best	O
protection	O
from	O

Some	O
