“Please	O

“I'm	O

sat	O
down	O
with	O
her	O

to	O
interview	O
them,	O
she	O
says	O

from	O

“I	O
wasn’t	O
ready.	O
I	O
knew	O
I	O
needed	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
love	O
was,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
marriage	O
and	O

because	O
these	O
are	O
such	O
important	O
realities	O
of	O
my	O
mother's	O
life.	O
And	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
holding	O

off.	O
“If	O

is	O
what	O
you're	O
looking	O

there	O
are	O
no	O

not	O

ever	O

again;	O
why	O
getting	O
married	O
at	O
16	O
was	O
the	O
greatest	O
regret	O
of	O
her	O
life;	O
how	O
she	O
had	O
seven	O
miscarriages	O
and	O
seven	O

questions	O
for	O
your	O

These	O

may	O
help	O
you	O
better	O

a	O

You’ll	O
ask	O
wiser	O

more	O
sensitive	O
questions,	O
thanks	O
to	O

grief	O

decades.	O

Recalling	O
these	O
kinds	O
of	O
memories	O
can	O
make	O
a	O
parent	O
feel	O
“really	O
sad	O
or	O
broken,”	O
she	O
adds.	O
So	O
if	O
they	O
get	O
emotional	O
while	O
you’re	O
interviewing	O
them,	O
don’t	O
smother	O
them	O
with	O
assurance.	O
“Your	O
instinct	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
‘It’s	O
OK,	O
I’m	O
here.’	O
But	O
you	O
weren’t	O
there.	O
You	O
don’t	O
know	O
the	O
magnitude	O
of	O
this	O
memory	O
in	O
comparison	O
to	O
everything	O
else	O
that	O
will	O
come	O
their	O
way.”	O
Instead,	O
sit	O
with	O
that	O
discomfort.	O
“Whatever	O
feelings	O
there	O
are,	O
be	O
brave	O
in	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
it.	O
Honor	O
its	O
place,”	O
says	O
Yang.	O
Sometimes	O
bravery	O
means	O
sitting	O
quietly	O
as	O
someone	O
convulses	O
in	O
tears.	O

remember	O
that	O
I'm	O
somebody	O
and	O
[they’re]	O
somebody.	O
And	O
that's	O
a	O
very	O
powerful	O
thing,”	O

She	O
recalls	O
her	O
father’s	O
story.	O
When	O

moved	O

the	O

he	O
suffered	O
a	O
huge	O

In	O
Korea,	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
marketing	O
executive,	O

in	O

he	O
ended	O
up	O
putting	O
on	O
a	O
suit	O
every	O
day	O
to	O
work	O
at	O
a	O
newspaper	O
stand.	O
People	O
would	O
toss	O

at	O
him.	O
“I’ve	O
been	O
in	O
situations	O
where	O
people	O
do	O
equivalent	O
things	O
to	O
me	O
metaphorically,”	O
says	O
Lee.	O
If	O
her	O
father	O
could	O
“withstand	O
that	O
level	O
of	O
humiliation,”	O
so	O
could	O
she.	O
Knowing	O
her	O
dad’s	O
highs	O
and	O
lows	O
gives	O
her	O
strength	O
“to	O
know	O
who	O
I	O
am	O
when	O
the	O
world	O
says	O
I’m	O
nobody.”	O
