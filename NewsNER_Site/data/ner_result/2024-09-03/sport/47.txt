Before	O
having	O
kids,	O
many	O
couples	O
have	O
a	O
general	O
sense	O
of	O
how	O
they	O
split	O
their	O
household	O
chores.	O
Maybe	O
one	O
partner	O
cooks	O
dinner	O
and	O
walks	O
the	O
dog,	O
maybe	O
the	O
other	O
cleans	O
up	O
and	O
runs	O
errands.	O
But	O
how	O
does	O
that	O
allocation	O
change	O
when	O
a	O
baby	O
comes	O
along?	O
Who	O
warms	O
the	O
bottles,	O
changes	O
the	O
diapers	O
or	O
shushes	O
baby	O
back	O
to	O
sleep?	O
That’s	O
what	O
couples	O
coach	O
Aaron	O
Steinberg	O
helps	O
expecting	O
parents	O
figure	O
out.	O
“The	O
division	O
of	O
roles	O
and	O
responsibilities	O
is	O
the	O
biggest	O
difficulty	O
that	O
parents	O
face”	O
when	O
bringing	O
home	O
a	O
new	O
baby,	O
he	O
says.	O
What	O
often	O
happens	O
is	O
that	O
both	O
parents	O
feel	O
like	O
they’re	O
taking	O
on	O
too	O
many	O
tasks,	O
he	O
says.	O
And	O
that	O
can	O
lead	O
to	O
resentment	O
--	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
stress	O
of	O
taking	O

To	O
prevent	O
this	O
from	O
happening,	O
says	O
Steinberg,	O
couples	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
conversation	O
about	O
how	O
to	O
manage	O
household	O
and	O
child	O

duties	O
well	O
before	O

to	O
create	O
