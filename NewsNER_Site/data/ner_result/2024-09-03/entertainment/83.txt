It	O
was	O
July	O

He	O

His	O

the	O

A	O

lover	O

he	O
and	O
his	O
brothers	O
had	O
in	O
1985	O
pledged	O
to	O
fund	O
a	O
major	O
extension	O
of	O
London's	O
National	O
Gallery.	O
(The	O
cost	O
was	O
undisclosed,	O
but	O
reportedly	O
in	O
the	O
tens	O
of	O

The	O

works	O
by	O
Degas,	O
Gauguin,	O

and	O

The	O
Sainsbury	O
Wing	O
was	O
inaugurated	O
by	O
Queen	O
Elizabeth	O
II	O
in	O
July	O
1991.	O
But	O
a	O
year	O
earlier,	O
during	O
its	O
construction,	O
Lord	O
Sainsbury	O
soured	O
on	O
its	O
design.	O
He	O
was	O
particularly	O
irked	O
by	O
two	O
columns	O
flanking	O
the	O
foyer	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
wing.	O
They	O
were	O
ornamental,	O
not	O
structural.	O
He	O
thought	O
they	O
were	O
useless,	O
and	O
ugly.	O
Sainsbury	O
funded	O
them	O
nonetheless,	O
but	O
typed	O
up	O
his	O
dissent	O
in	O
that	O
1990	O
letter.	O
More	O
than	O
three	O
decades	O
later,	O
the	O
Sainsbury	O
Wing	O
is	O
under	O
renovation	O
again.	O
Last	O
winter,	O
demolition	O
workers	O
took	O
down	O
those	O
two	O
columns,	O
and	O
discovered	O
Sainsbury's	O
letter	O
hidden	O
inside	O
one	O
of	O
them,	O
in	O
a	O
plastic	O

It	O
reads:	O

His	O

told	O
the	O

that	O
his	O
father's	O
brother	O
and	O
fellow	O
donor,	O
the	O
late	O
Simon	O

forged	O
a	O

convincing	O
John	O

to	O
go	O
ahead	O
with	O
their	O
donation,	O
in	O
exchange	O
for	O
registering	O
his	O
dissent	O
about	O
the	O
design,	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
this	O
secret	O
letter.	O
"He	O
was	O
never	O
one	O
to	O

he	O

raise	O
an	O

a	O

that	O
finally	O
we'd	O
all	O

Mark	O
Sainsbury	O
said	O
about	O
the	O
letter's	O
recent	O
discovery.	O
When	O
the	O
Sainsbury	O
Wing	O
was	O
originally	O
built,	O
the	O
director	O
of	O
the	O
National	O
Gallery	O
was	O
Neil	O

In	O
an	O
interview	O
published	O
this	O

with	O
The	O

an	O

recalled	O
this	O

between	O
Sainsbury	O
and	O
the	O
wing's	O
architects,	O
Robert	O
Venturi	O
and	O
Denise	O
Scott	O

But	O
MacGregor	O
says	O
he	O
ultimately	O
approved	O
the	O
design.	O
"I	O
felt	O
that,	O
on	O
balance,	O
we	O
should	O
let	O
the	O
architect	O
be	O
the	O
architect,"	O
he	O
was	O
quoted	O
as	O
saying.	O
Sainsbury's	O
widow	O
Anya,	O
a	O

was	O
present	O
when	O
her	O
