    "text": "\u2018How Wild\u2019 podcast explores America\u2019s most protected lands and what \u2018wilderness\u2019 really means\n\ntoggle caption KALW/NPR\n\nTuesday, August 6, 2024 \u2013 San Francisco \u2013 What makes a place wild? A new podcast, How Wild, produced by San Francisco\u2019s KALW Public Media and distributed by the NPR Network, aims to answer this crucial question as climate change, increased visitation, and new technology are testing the definition of \u201cwilderness.\" This seven-episode series will launch on August 13, to mark the 100th anniversary of the world\u2019s first designated wilderness region. Hosted by KALW\u2019s Marissa Ortega-Welch, How Wild listeners will visit public lands in the American West to explore the concept of wilderness, how it's changing, and how the stories we tell about wilderness say a lot more about us than the land.\n\n\u201cAs a long-time backpacker and former naturalist in National Parks and Forests, I\u2019ve noticed a lot of changes over the years,\u201d says Ortega-Welch. \u201cMore wildfires, trails becoming more and more crowded, and people using their phones to navigate instead of a paper map. I\u2019m fascinated by how these changes are testing the meaning of wilderness, in both good and bad ways. How do we think about what is \u2018natural\u2019 in the era of climate change? How do we think about these areas as being places where humans are just \u2018visitors\u2019 while also recognizing the long history of management of these lands by Indigenous peoples?\u201d\n\nListen to the trailer.\n\nA hundred years ago, the U.S. Forest Service set aside the first official wilderness in the world: the Gila Wilderness in New Mexico. Forty years later, the 1964 Wilderness Act defined wilderness as \u201can area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.\u201d Today, there are more than 800 wilderness areas across the U.S.\n\nJoin our host as she traverses the country speaking with hikers, land managers, scientists, environmentalists, and Indigenous leaders. These conversations lead to a deep dive on the criteria used to measure wilderness: natural, undeveloped, untrammeled, opportunities for solitude and primitive, unconfined recreation, and other features of value. How Wild examines the credence of those qualities, what dominant narratives they rely on, what histories and perspectives they might leave out, and how we might think about managing wilderness into the future.\n\nHow Wild is produced by NPR affiliate KALW Public Media and distributed by the NPR Network. Funding and support for How Wild is provided by California Humanities, a partner of the NEH; KALW Public Media San Francisco; and University of Colorado Boulder\u2019s Center for Environmental Journalism.\n\nAbout Marissa Ortega-Welch (Host)\n\nMarissa is an award-winning radio and print journalist, whose stories have been featured by NPR, Reveal, Latino USA, The California Report Magazine, and High Country News magazine, among others.
