    "text": "$5.5 Million Grant from Eric and Wendy Schmidt to Expand NPR Collaborative Journalism Network\n\nGrant will fund regional newsrooms in Appalachia and the Mountain West and a visual journalism pilot in New England\n\nJuly 10, 2024; Washington, D.C.\u2014 NPR announced today that it has received a $5.5 million grant from philanthropists Eric and Wendy Schmidt to further expand public media\u2019s collaborative journalism efforts. The grant will enable NPR and its partners to create a regional newsroom in Appalachia and the neighboring area; bolster an existing public media collaboration, the Mountain West News Bureau; conduct a multistation visual journalism pilot in New England, and support the continued growth of the California and Midwest newsrooms.\n\nThis grant follows a $4.7 million gift from Eric and Wendy Schmidt in 2020, which created two regional newsrooms in the Collaborative Journalism Network. This additional investment of $5.5 million over three years will enable public radio stations to reach and serve more communities with local, multi-platform public service journalism.\n\n\u201cLocal news organizations are essential to our communities, providing not only a sense of identity and connection but also a spotlight on local challenges like land rights, voting abuses, the impact of extractive industries and air and water quality,\u201d said Wendy Schmidt, co-founder and president of the Schmidt Family Foundation. \u201cEric and I believe deeply in investing in NPR\u2019s work to strengthen our democracy, protect human rights, expose wrongs and uplift voices that deserve to be heard.\u201d\n\nThe creation of additional regional newsrooms will provide needed resources to boost coverage and investigative journalism in communities with limited access to local reporting. In the greater Appalachia region, the newsroom will bring together six public media outlets in Kentucky and Tennessee, with the possibility of adding more. The Mountain West News Bureau, an existing 14-station collaboration serving Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, will become a regional newsroom under the Collaborative Journalism Network. NPR\u2019s collaboration with the newsrooms will help strengthen reporting on issues impacting Indigenous and Native communities, develop a talent pipeline and provide opportunities for professional development and training, and create a shared services model that will provide support for small stations.\n\nThrough the grant, a new pilot in partnership with the 10 station New England News Collaborative will expand short-form video news coverage. This pilot will build on existing infrastructure and expertise at NPR and stations. It will also provide training and mentorship to build visual storytelling capacity and knowledge of best practices for digital platforms.\n\n\u201cLocal journalism is vital to creating a more informed public and is the core of NPR and public media\u2019s mission. This gift is a continued investment in our current regional newsrooms and provides the necessary resources to support expanding our collaborative journalism efforts,\u201d said Edith Chapin, NPR\u2019s Senior Vice President, Editor in Chief and acting Chief Content Officer. \u201cThe multiplatform and investigative reporting from our journalists continues to spotlight critical stories directly from communities across the country.\u201d\n\nThe California and Midwest newsrooms were established in 2021, and they have since produced award-winning journalism and public service investigations, including stories recognized with prestigious regional Edward R. Murrow Awards. The grant will continue to support these existing regional newsrooms and will allow them to connect more public media journalists, develop new partnerships, and invest in content that meets the needs of local audiences. The grant will also strengthen local news coverage in Nebraska and Iowa as part of the Midwest Newsroom.\n\nAbout Eric and Wendy Schmidt\n\nEric and Wendy Schmidt have been active philanthropists since 2006, when they started the Schmidt Family Foundation to address challenges facing communities around the world, working for clean renewable energy, healthy food systems, healthy oceans and the protection of human rights.
