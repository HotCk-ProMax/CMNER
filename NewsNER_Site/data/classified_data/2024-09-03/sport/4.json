And aging and Alzheimer\u2019s disease both seem to leave the brain underpowered.\n\nBut an experimental cancer drug appeared to re-energize the brains of mice that had a form of Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 and even restore their ability to learn and remember.\n\nThe finding, published in the journal Science, suggests that it may eventually be possible to reverse some symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s in people, using drugs that boost brain metabolism.\n\nThe results also offer an approach to treatment that\u2019s unlike anything on the market today. Current drugs for treating Alzheimer\u2019s, such as lecanemab and donanemab, target the sticky amyloid plaques that build up in a patient\u2019s brain. These drugs can remove plaques and slow the disease process, but do not improve memory or thinking.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe result should help \u201cchange how we think about targeting this disease,\u201d says Shannon Macauley , an associate professor at the University of Kentucky who was not involved in the study.\n\n\n\nA surprise, then a discovery\n\nThe new research was prompted by a lab experiment that didn\u2019t go as planned.\n\nA team at Stanford was studying an enzyme called IDO1 that plays a key role in keeping a cell\u2019s metabolism running properly. They suspected that in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, IDO1 was malfunctioning in a way that limited the brain\u2019s ability to turn nutrients into energy.\n\nSo the team used genetics to eliminate the enzyme entirely from mice that develop a form of Alzheimer\u2019s. They figured that without any IDO1, brain metabolism would decline.\n\n\u201cWe expected to see everything [get] much, much, much worse\u201d, says Dr. Katrin Andreasson , a professor of neurology and neuroscience at Stanford. \u201cBut no, it was the complete opposite.\u201d\n\nWithout the enzyme, the mouse brains were actually better at turning glucose into energy and didn\u2019t exhibit the memory loss usually associated with Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt was such a profound rescue that we sort of went back to the drawing board and tried to figure out what was going on,\u201d Andreasson says.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEventually, the team found an explanation.\n\nGetting rid of the enzyme had altered the behavior of cells called astrocytes.\n\nUsually, astrocytes help provide energy to neurons, the cells that allow for learning and memory. But when the toxic plaques and tangles of Alzheimer\u2019s begin to appear in the brain, levels of IDO1 rise and astrocytes stop doing this job.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re kind of put to sleep,\u201d Andreasson says. So \u201cyou\u2019ve got to wake them up to get them to help the neurons.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s what happened when scientists used genetics to remove IDO1.\n\nTheir hypothesis was that high levels of IDO1 were limiting the astrocytes\u2019 ability to produce lactate, a chemical that helps brain cells, including neurons, transform food into energy.\n\nTo confirm the hypothesis, the team, led by Dr. Paras Minhas , did a series of experiments. One involved placing a mouse in the center of a shiny white disk under a bright light.\n\n\u201cIt really wants to get out of there,\u201d Andreasson says. \u201cBut it has to learn where the escape hole is\u201d by following visual cues.\n\nHealthy mice learned how to read those cues after a few days of training, and would escape almost instantly.\n\n\u201cBut in the Alzheimer mice, the time to find the escape hole really skyrocketed,\u201d Andreasson says.\n\nThat changed when the team gave these mice an experimental cancer drug that could block the enzyme much the way genetic engineering had.\n\nThe treated mice learned to escape the bright light as quickly as healthy animals. And a look at their brains showed that their astrocytes had woken up and were helping neurons produce the energy needed for memory and thinking.\n\nIn the hippocampus, a brain area that\u2019s critical for memory and navigation, tests showed that the drug had restored normal glucose metabolism even though the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer\u2019s were still present.\n\nThe team also tested human astrocytes and neurons derived from Alzheimer\u2019s patients. And once again, the drug restored normal function.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBeyond plaques and tangles\n\nThe experiments add to the evidence that Alzheimer\u2019s involves a lot more than just the appearance of plaques and tangles.\n\n\u201cWe can have these metabolic changes in our brain,\u201d Macaulay says, \u201cbut they\u2019re reversible.\u201d\n\nNeurons have long been the focus of Alzheimer\u2019s research. But the new results also show how other kinds of cells in the brain can play an important role in the disease.\n\nThe brain is a bit like a beehive, where a neuron is the queen, Macaulay says. But she\u2019s kept alive by worker bees, like astrocytes, which are asked to do more as Alzheimer\u2019s changes the brain.\n\n\u201cThose worker bees are getting unbelievably taxed from all the things they are being asked to do,\u201d Macaulay says. \u201cWhen that happens, then the whole system doesn\u2019t work well.\u201d\n\nMetabolic treatments that restore astrocytes and other helper cells in the brain could someday augment existing Alzheimer\u2019s drugs that remove amyloid plaques, Macauley says.\n\nAnd the metabolic approach may be able to improve memory and thinking \u2014 something amyloid drugs don\u2019t do.\n\n\u201cMaybe this can make your astrocytes and your neurons work a little bit better, so that you function a little bit better,\u201d Macaulay says.\n\nBut first, she says, the promising results will have to be replicated in people.",
