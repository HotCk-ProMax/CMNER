Holmes who ran the anchor leg for the finish waved the baton in the air and grinned big as she crossed the line.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt was the eighth time in a row that the U.S. women claimed gold in the Olympic event.\n\nA few minutes earlier U.S. men held off a strong challenge from Botswana in the men's 4-by-400m relay final before the roaring crowd at Stade de France to win Olympic gold.\n\ntoggle caption Patrick Smith/Getty Images\n\nThe men's team took a sizable lead after the second hand-off. But Botswana kept closing the gap and in the end the American runners finished with only a tenth-of-a-second to spare.\n\n\"We were pushed to the limit. Botswana did a great job,\" said Vernon Norwood of the U.S.\n\nAmerican Rai Benjamin finished it out for the men in a tense footrace with Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, who had won gold in the 200 meter men's final on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. performance was strong enough for a gold medal and set a new Olympic record in the event. Botswana took silver and Great Britain the bronze.\n\n\"It was really a tough race,\" Tebogo said. \"I had to chase and close the gap. But it didn't come out.\"\n\nQuincy Wilson, the 16-year-old high school student from Maryland, who emerged this year as a teen track phenomenon didn't run in the final, but he competed in an earlier qualifying heat and will share the gold.\n\n",
