Talking really helps\n\ntoggle caption Annika McFarlane/Getty Images\n\nFor many pre-teens and teens, a new school year brings big changes: new routines, different classes and changing friendships (both in real life and online).\n\nParents can help kids navigate these transitions by understanding their feelings and finding ways to better support them. A new survey published in July provides fresh insight into the emotional landscape of today\u2019s Gen Z youth.\n\nConducted by the Walton Family Foundation (a funder of NPR) and Gallup, in partnership with teen psychologist Lisa Damour , the group surveyed 1,675 children ages 10 to 18 and one of their guardians. It found that Gen Z kids felt pressure to be perfect and increased negative emotions like anxiety, especially among girls and teens.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBeing a pre-teen and teen has always been hard, says Damour. But this generation of children faces unique challenges. \u201cWe're asking a lot of them academically. They are trying to navigate a social media environment that can be very taxing for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd young people worry about big things, like their future,\u201d she adds. About two-thirds of Gen Z youth worry about what the world will be like when they are adults, according to the survey.\n\nDamour, author of Untangled, Under Pressure and The Emotional Lives of Teenagers, talks to NPR about what parents can learn from the findings from the Gallup study.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude07 Remind your teen they don\u2019t have to be perfect\n\nAbout one in three Gen Zers struggle with perfectionism, according to the survey \u2014 especially girls, teens and oldest children.\n\nThat can affect a child\u2019s self esteem, says Damour. The study found that those who say they need to be perfect were \u201cmore likely than those who do not feel that pressure to say they felt anxious, sad and stressed a lot the prior day.\u201d\n\nSo help your teen get comfortable with making mistakes, she says. \u201cLet them recognize the mistake while still having a general sense of positive self-regard.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTell them that \u201cwhile we are working on our shortcomings, we still can feel we are good, worthy and decent,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd make sure they hear from you that they don\u2019t need to be perfect \u2014 it may help reduce negative emotions that come with striving for perfection, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Talk to your teen. They want to hear from you\n\nAbout one in six parents struggle to comfort their child or communicate with them when they are upset, found the survey . They assume that their teens don\u2019t want to talk to them, or may not be receptive to a conversation.\n\n\u201cBut what we heard from teenagers is how helpful these conversations are and how much they care about what adults have to say,\u201d says Damour. \u201cSo my advice to anyone caring for a teenager is to go ahead and have a conversation about whatever it is you're worried about.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure what to do, just listen, she says. That was the No. 1 response when Damour asked the teens: What can adults do to be helpful when you\u2019re upset? \u201cSecond to that: \u2018Take our feelings seriously.\u2019 Very low down the list was \u2018offer advice.\u2019 \u201c\n\nLook for natural openings in everyday conversation to bring up your concerns, she says. \u201cOnce your kid is talking about it, that is a great time to say, \u2018it sounds like your friend's having a hard time at school. How are things feeling for you at school?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfa2 Be OK with your kid\u2019s roller coaster of emotions\n\nThe emotional lives of preteens and teenagers are complex, according to the findings . Nearly all the children surveyed said they \u201cfelt happiness a lot of the prior day,\u201d but 45% also felt stressed, 38% anxious and 23% sad.\n\n\u201cThe takeaway here is that kids have lots of moods, good and bad,\u201d says Damour.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn general, teens have more intense emotions, says Damour. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a sign that anything is wrong. It\u2019s actually a sign of forward development.\u201d\n\nParents can better navigate big mood swings by \u201cthinking about it the way psychologists think about it: having feelings that fit what\u2019s happening \u2014 and managing those feelings,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIf your kid isn't invited to a party that all their friends seem to be going to, they will be sad. That is the expected emotion. It would be strange if they didn't feel it,\u201d says Damour.\n\nKids already have great coping skills that they turn to comfort themselves, according to the report. \u201cMaybe they have a good cry, cuddle their dog, go for a run,\u201d says Damour. Parents should only worry \u201cif they're using coping strategies that are harmful.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it is OK to have negative emotions. It's what we do with them that counts, she says.\n\nThe digital story was written by Malaka Gharib and edited by Andee Tagle and Meghan Keane.
