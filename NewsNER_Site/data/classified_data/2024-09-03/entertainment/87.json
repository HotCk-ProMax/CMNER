    "text": "The Gallagher brothers are reviving Oasis. Here's a look at their decades-long feud\n\ntoggle caption PA Images via Getty Images\n\nFifteen years after Oasis imploded, the dueling brothers at the heart of the beloved British band have confirmed fans' far-fetched dreams of a reunion tour.\n\nOn Monday, Noel and Liam Gallagher \u2014 the band\u2019s main songwriter and singer, respectively \u2014 each tweeted out an 11-second video with the date and time of Aug. 27 at 8 a.m., flickering in the Oasis font. The Oasis Instagram account shared it, too.\n\nThe posts came a day after Britain\u2019s Sunday Times reported that anonymous industry insiders were \u201cadamant\u201d that the two would reunite for a series of high-profile concerts next summer, including a headlining slot at the Glastonbury Festival and what would be a record 10-night run at Wembley Stadium.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cSee you down the front,\u201d Liam then replied in a thread about the article on the social platform X.\n\nHe also posted a cryptic tweet of his own: \u201cI never did like that word FORMER.\u201d\n\nOasis, which started as a five-person band out of Manchester in 1991, is credited with reviving the genre of Britpop music, fueled in part by its rivalry with the London-based band Blur.\n\nThe group rose to fame with its 1994 album, Definitely Maybe, and cemented its legacy with such hits as \u201cWonderwall,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back in Anger\u201d and \u201cChampagne Supernova.\u201d As of three decades later, Oasis had sold 75 million records worldwide.\n\nThe Gallaghers, the only constant members of the band's ever-changing lineup, became known for their splashy antics onstage and across the tabloid pages \u2014 as well as their own deepening rivalry.\n\nYears of insults, incidents and infighting culminated on Aug. 28, 2009, when the band broke up minutes before they were set to take the stage at the Rock en Seine festival in Paris.\n\n\u201cPeople will write and say what they like, but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer,\u201d Noel wrote in a statement at the time. He would later recount a backstage argument in which his younger brother grabbed his guitar and started \u201cwielding it like an axe.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Gallaghers went their separate ways, but continued their careers in music: Liam and other Oasis members kept the band going under the name Beady Eye, while Noel formed his own band, High Flying Birds.\n\nThe two have performed their old hits separately over the years, though never with each other.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve publicly floated the prospect of a reunion more than once, including in 2015 and 2018. But such a reconciliation had yet to materialize \u2014 and the two continued taking very public swipes at each other on social media.\n\nEagle-eyed hopefuls, however, had spotted hints that detente could be on the horizon.\n\nWhile performing at the Reading Festival on Sunday, Liam dedicated the Oasis song \u201cHalf The World Away\u201d to his brother and \u201cCigarettes & Alcohol\u201d to haters of the band. As his set ended, the onstage screens flashed that same Aug. 27 announcement video.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, almost exactly 15 years to the day after Oasis broke up, the brothers confirmed they will indeed be getting back together.\n\nThey shared identical videos advertising \"Oasis live '25,\" a series of concerts across the United Kingdom and Ireland next July and August, with tickets going on sale this weekend. The year 2025, notably, will mark 30 years since the release of their second album, (What\u2019s The Story) Morning Glory.\n\n\"The guns have fallen silent. The stars have aligned,\" the brothers also tweeted. \"The great wait is over. Come see. It will not be televised.\"\n\nThe hints and ensuing announcement have caused quite a stir on social media, where scores of the group\u2019s fans have been posting about the cultural significance \u2014 and personal finance implications \u2014 of an Oasis reunion tour.\n\nAnd many have joked that those looking to buy tickets should aim for the first night only, lest the famously fight-prone brothers break up the band once again. It wouldn't be the first time.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA brief timeline of the Gallagher feud, from fisticuffs to legal battles\n\ntoggle caption Dave Hogan/Getty Images\n\nNoel and Liam\u2019s tumultuous relationship goes back decades, blazing a trail of barbs and bad blood that is nearly impossible to detail in full (though outlets like Pitchfork , Rolling Stone and Radio X have bravely attempted).\n\nHere are some of the highlights, or low points:\n\n\n\nApril 1994: Shortly before their commercial breakthrough, the brothers sit for an interview with NME\u2019s John Harris and spend the entire time bickering \u2014 over the meaning of rock and roll, a drunken incident on a ferry several months earlier and how much they hated each other, among other things. A year later, they release the audio as a single called \u201cWibbling Rivalry\u201d (subtitle: \u201cfourteen minutes of verbal mayhem\u201d).\n\nShortly before their commercial breakthrough, the brothers sit for an interview with NME\u2019s John Harris and spend the entire time bickering \u2014 over the meaning of rock and roll, a drunken incident on a ferry several months earlier and how much they hated each other, among other things.

August 2009: Oasis abruptly cancels its set at the V Festival in England, with Liam blaming a case of laryngitis. Years later, Noel claims his brother was actually hungover, which prompted Liam to sue him for libel (he eventually dropped the suit). That month, Noel quits the band for real. He told NPR about it in 2012: \u201cWe were backstage waiting to go onstage to 30,000 people in Paris. The tour manager came in and said, 'Five minutes!' We broke up within that five minutes. I'm not proud of that, but all things come to an end.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe brothers kept slinging insults years after the breakup\n\nThe Gallaghers kept fighting long after they were no longer bandmates, insulting each other in awards speeches, interviews and social media posts (including the infamous 2016 \u201cpotato\u201d tweet, which became a yearslong bit of its own).\n\nThere were occasional public calls for reconciliation interspersed throughout the drama, giving fans brief glimmers of hope.\n\nLiam hinted at a truce in 2017 but called it off a month later. In 2018, he tweeted at his brother suggesting a reunion, but after no reply wrote, \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a NO then.\u201d During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Noel released a previously hidden song recorded in 1995, to Liam\u2019s apparent displeasure.\n\nBut by 2023, both brothers seemed to be taking the idea of a reunion more seriously.\n\nNotably, that same year, Blur \u2014 their Britpop archrival, which had been on hiatus since 2015 \u2014 reunited to release an album and perform at a number of summer festivals. The Ballad of Darren was critically acclaimed, with outlets from the BBC to Mojo to NPR including it on their best-of-the-year lists. The group closed out its triumphant 2023 by announcing another hiatus.\n\n\u201cIf Oasis hadn\u2019t had reached their potential, and there was something left to do, it would be different, but I just don\u2019t see what the point would be,\u201d Noel said in a January 2023 interview. \u201cIt would be make a load of money, I\u2019ve got a load of money. To do some monumental [venue] I\u2019ve already done them.\"\n\nBut he left the door open to the possibility, adding: \u201cNow, that\u2019s not saying, in 10 years' time, it won\u2019t appeal to me...\"\n\nTwo months later, Liam responded to a fan\u2019s tweet asking if there was any chance Oasis might get back together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd now it's official.",
