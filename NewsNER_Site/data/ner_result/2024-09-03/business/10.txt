Workers	O
are	O
demanding	O
higher	O

more	O

The	O
union	O
says	O
that	O
cuts	O
to	O
staffing	O
and	O
guest	O
services	O
that	O
many	O
hotels	O
made	O
during	O
the	O

were	O

The	O
American	O
Hotel	O
And	O
Lodging	O
Association	O
(AHLA),	O
the	O
trade	O
group	O
representing	O
major	O
hotel	O
operators,	O
said	O
that	O
during	O
the	O
first	O
half	O
of	O
this	O
year	O
86%	O
of	O
its	O
member	O
hotels	O
reported	O
increased	O
wages.	O
Since	O
the	O
pandemic,	O
average	O
wages	O
for	O
hotel	O
workers	O
have	O
risen	O
26%,	O
the	O
group	O
said.	O
Many	O
hotel	O
workers	O
say	O
their	O
pay	O
doesn’t	O
meet	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
living,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
work	O
multiple	O
jobs	O
to	O
pay	O
the	O
bills.	O
“During	O
COVID,	O
everyone	O
suffered,	O
but	O
now	O
the	O
hotel	O
industry	O
is	O
making	O
record	O
profits	O
while	O
workers	O
and	O
guests	O
are	O
left	O
behind,”	O
said	O
Gwen	O
Mills,	O
international	O
president	O
of	O

“Many	O
can	O
no	O
longer	O
afford	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
the	O
cities	O
that	O
they	O
welcome	O
guests	O
to,	O
and	O
painful	O
workloads	O
are	O
breaking	O
their	O
bodies.	O
We	O
won’t	O
accept	O
a	O
‘new	O
normal’	O
where	O
hotel	O
companies	O
profit	O
by	O
cutting	O
their	O
offerings	O
to	O
guests	O
and	O
abandoning	O
their	O
commitments	O
to	O

AHLA	O
says	O
it's	O
navigating	O
a	O
labor	O
shortage	O
and	O
that	O
occupancy	O
rates	O
have	O
not	O
caught	O
up	O
to	O

levels.	O
Some	O
80%	O
of	O

report	O

shortages,	O
while	O
50%	O
cite	O
housekeeping	O
as	O
their	O
greatest	O

it	O

Even	O
so,	O
the	O
hotel	O

expects	O
to	O
see	O
record	O
high	O

that	O
when	O

eight	O

he	O

his	O

after	O
