    "text": "How to reveal a parent's hidden story\n\ntoggle caption Ippei Naoi/Getty Images/Moment RF\n\nIn 2019, I published my first book, a migrant memoir called Here We Are. Mom was a seamstress; Dad a shopkeeper. He was also my archnemesis: the dating and dancing police, the auditor of skirt lengths, the man more concerned with his daughter\u2019s marriage prospects than her career ambitions.\n\nThen, his career ended abruptly. Dad got arrested for selling calculators to a drug cartel. He landed in Rikers Island and then deportation proceedings. After the initial shock wore off, and I witnessed how the justice system mistreated him, I decided to stop going to school in order to fight his case. I was 19.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhen I went on a book tour, the most frequently asked question I got was not: what do you think about immigration or criminal justice policy? It was: how can I get to know my dad or my mom? Dad\u2019s legal crisis created an unlikely runway for a rebellious teen and an Old World man to become the best of friends. While people didn\u2019t envy the circumstances, they did envy the relationship.\n\nTalking to a parent about their personal history can be tough \u2013 especially if they have painful, shameful or traumatic memories, or if you\u2019ve had a strained relationship. That said, so many of us want to deepen our connection with loved ones. I spoke to fellow writers experienced in family memoir generally, and the migrant journey specifically, about how to start the conversation.\n\n\n\n1. Give them a heads up\n\nYour family history is not a pile of dirt. You are not an industrial-strength vacuum. Don\u2019t approach your mom or dad like you\u2019ve got to take in everything everywhere all at once.\n\nIf you\u2019re suddenly burning to probe your parent\u2019s past, do not pick up the phone, says author Min Jin Lee, best known for the bestselling historical fiction Pachinko. Over the past few years, Lee has been interviewing family members for her first nonfiction book. \u201cPlease do not surprise anyone, especially people whom you love.\u201d\n\nThink about what you want to learn and then ask in advance. \u201cWould it be OK if I came by to ask you some questions?\u201d she says.\n\nAllow the person to say yes or no. \u201cI'm gonna sound corny, but please proceed with love,\u201d says Lee. \u201cYou have a family bond. That's a very serious thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n2. Don\u2019t throw curveballs\n\nThis advice is antithetical to what journalists often do. Our industry values curveball questions because they catch powerful people off guard (some call it the \u2018\u201cgotcha\u201d question). But it can shut folks down.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOne way to build trust is to ease into the hard stuff. When Lee sat down with her parents to interview them, she says she asked them simple, factual questions first. \u201cWhere did you study? How did you feel? What do you remember about your parents? What are their actual names? How do you spell it?\u201d\n\n3. Play the long game\n\nWait until the right time to ask questions that may stir up difficult memories. Kao Kalia Yang, a Hmong refugee and author of the memoir Where Rivers Part: A Story of My Mother\u2019s Life, made herself wait decades before asking her mom Tswb about her harrowing journey to the U.S. from war-torn Laos.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t ready. I knew I needed to know what love was, and perhaps marriage and motherhood, because these are such important realities of my mother's life. And so I was holding back,\u201d Yang says.\n\nYang\u2019s patience paid off. \u201cIf a deeper understanding is what you're looking for, then there are no shortcuts,\u201d she says. Her book recounts Tswb\u2019s life story in first person: how she left her mother in a jungle where they\u2019d taken refuge, not realizing they\u2019d ever meet again; why getting married at 16 was the greatest regret of her life; how she had seven miscarriages and seven babies.\n\nSo play the long game. Time your deep questions for your parents with rites of passage in your life. That may include having a child, losing a job or going through a breakup. These moments may help you better empathize with a parent. You\u2019ll ask wiser and more sensitive questions, thanks to your hard-earned experience. They may be more likely to respond in turn.\n\n\n\n4. Allow the tears to flow\n\nWhen Yang began probing the past with her mom Tswb, the intention was to help her. It was an act of service. Tswb had been drowning in grief for decades. \u201cShe wakes up all the time from this nightmare in the jungle. She's young and my father is holding her hand and tugging her away, and she watches her mother standing there, looking. And she runs with my father. And she never sees her mother again. Which is, of course, the story of her life,\u201d says Yang.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRecalling these kinds of memories can make a parent feel \u201creally sad or broken,\u201d she adds. So if they get emotional while you\u2019re interviewing them, don\u2019t smother them with assurance. \u201cYour instinct is to say \u2018It\u2019s OK, I\u2019m here.\u2019 But you weren\u2019t there. You don\u2019t know the magnitude of this memory in comparison to everything else that will come their way.\u201d\n\nInstead, sit with that discomfort. \u201cWhatever feelings there are, be brave in the face of it. Honor its place,\u201d says Yang. Sometimes bravery means sitting quietly as someone convulses in tears.\n\n\n\n5. Draw strength from their stories\n\nMemories that make your parents feel ashamed, deep dark secrets they\u2019ve held for decades \u2013 those can end up being a source of empowerment for you. \u201cIn my conversations with my family members and knowing their history and their struggle, I remember that I'm somebody and [they\u2019re] somebody. And that's a very powerful thing,\u201d says Lee.\n\nShe recalls her father\u2019s story. When he moved to the States, he suffered a huge setback professionally. In Korea, he was a marketing executive, but in New York City, he ended up putting on a suit every day to work at a newspaper stand. People would toss coins at him. \u201cI\u2019ve been in situations where people do equivalent things to me metaphorically,\u201d says Lee. If her father could \u201cwithstand that level of humiliation,\u201d so could she.\n\nKnowing her dad\u2019s highs and lows gives her strength \u201cto know who I am when the world says I\u2019m nobody.\u201d\n\n\n\n6. Protect yourself\n\nA lot of people have been abused by our parents physically or emotionally. Even if you\u2019re an adult, you may still be at risk of your parent harming you in ways that just aren\u2019t worth it.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSahaj Kaur Kohli, a practicing therapist and author of But What Will People Say, a new book about navigating mental health between cultures, says that before she could probe her parents\u2019 past, she needed to move out, become financially independent and get therapy for herself.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have that feeling of safety, she says, \u201cthe dynamic is not in a place where it would even be healing\u201d to approach your mom or dad.\n\n\n\n7. Don\u2019t record, unless\u2026\n\nLee says she never records her interviews. As soon as you hit \u201crecord,\u201d people change. They get stiff. Invisible walls go up. Instead, she opts for writing down responses with a pen and paper.\n\nThat said, I know I needed to record my dad at least one time. I did it years into our adult friendship, shortly before he passed away. My family doesn\u2019t have heirlooms. I wanted a piece of Dad\u2019s voice to give to my son \u2013 who never got to meet Dad, but has the same single dimple on his cheek.\n\nSometimes intentions conflict, I suppose.\n\nThis episode was produced by Margaret Cirino.
