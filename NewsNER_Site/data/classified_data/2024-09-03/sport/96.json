The militant group has informed mediators to implement the plan they have been talking about for weeks instead of creating new talks.\n\ntoggle caption Abdel Kareem Hana/AP\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 NPR\u2019s Hadeel Al-Shalchi tells Up First this is one of the worst Israeli attacks since the beginning of the war in October. The U.N. has called the Israeli bombing of schools systemic and says over 450 schools have been hit or damaged as of the beginning of July. The Israeli military named 19 militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad that they say were killed in the strike. As Palestinians are given evacuation orders, Al-Shalchi says the images coming from Gaza are of desperate, exhausted families. The U.N. says Gaza has become unlivable due to the outbreak of diseases, a lack of clean water and piles of garbage everywhere.\n\nUkrainian troops and Russian reinforcements appear to be gearing up for a major confrontation in the villages and towns of western Russia. Last week, Ukrainian forces surged into Russia\u2019s Kursk region, just across the border from Ukraine, catching Russia by surprise. They encountered limited resistance in the first few days of the campaign. Over the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the operation is intended to \u201cpush the war into the aggressor\u2019s territory.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian military commanders say they will soon reclaim its border.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 \u201cThe Ukrainians are cheering because it\u2019s going well so far. But the coming days are full of danger,\u201d NPR\u2019s Greg Myre says. Ukrainian forces are already stretched thin in the main battleground of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, where the Russians are gaining ground. The fighting inside Russia has resulted in casualties on both sides but no major losses. Tens of thousands of Russian civilians fled the area that was invaded, saying they had no warning and there was no organized evacuation. Putin has promised the Russians who\u2019ve lost everything a payment of 10,000 rubles, which is about $115.\n\nThe Paris Olympics came to a close last night after over two weeks of competition and controversy. The U.S. came out on top with 126 medals overall, including 40 gold. In the pool, U.S. swimmers, led by Katie Ledecky and Torri Huske, racked up 28 medals. Athletes were even more dominant on the track, winning 34 total medals. But Team USA is one medal down after a ruling made yesterday required U.S. gymnast Jordan Chiles to return the bronze medal she won during the floor exercise final. A last-minute inquiry by her coach boosted her score by a tenth of a point, putting her in third place. Romania protested the inquiry, saying that it came four seconds late. USA Gymnastics says it has video proof otherwise and is now challenging that ruling.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 The lavish closing ceremony included a medal ceremony and a handoff from Paris to Los Angeles, where the next Games will be held.

Grand Teton National Park borders the land on three sides. Birds and butterflies cruise over the sloping hills of sagebrush and aspen groves by the mountains. In March, after an outcry over a proposal to auction it off, state legislators detailed a plan to sell the state-owned, 640-acre parcel to Grand Teton National Park for $100 million. Now the land has become a bargaining chip for leaders who are asking for a few other things, too.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 See photos of the land and read more about what could happen.\n\n3 things to know before you go\n\ntoggle caption Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images\n\nResearchers say an ancient pillar found in southern Turkey could be the world\u2019s oldest lunisolar calendar.
