Penca:	O
On	O
this	O
expedition,	O
we	O
weren't	O
recovering,	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
looking	O
out	O
for	O
artifacts	O
for	O
future	O
recovery.	O
And	O
there	O
was	O
one	O
artifact	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
our	O
list.	O
It	O
was	O
a	O
bronze	O
statue	O
about	O
two	O
feet	O
tall,	O
known	O
as	O
the	O
Diana	O
of	O
Versailles.	O
This	O
statue	O
sat	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
class	O
lounge	O
aboard	O
Titanic,	O
and	O
this	O
statue	O
was	O
the	O
centerpiece	O
of	O
that	O
elegant	O
room.	O
The	O
trouble	O
with	O
this	O
artifact	O
is,	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
photographed	O
only	O
one	O
time,	O
in	O
1986.	O
So,	O
to	O
find	O
this	O
statue	O
to	O
us	O
would	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
achievements	O
of	O
this	O
expedition,	O
but	O
the	O
odds	O
of	O
finding	O
it,	O
it's	O
truly	O
a	O

to	O

Diana	O
and	O
take	O
her	O

aspects	O
of	O
the	O

have	O
been	O
found	O
and	O

the	O

But	O
on	O
the	O
other	O

there	O
was	O
some	O
evidence	O
you	O
gathered	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
iconic	O

of	O
the	O

may	O
be	O

Penca:	O
Yeah,	O
so	O
everyone	O
knows	O
the	O
famous	O
James	O
Cameron	O
film,	O
the	O
“I'm	O

scene,	O
you	O
know,	O
“I’m	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
the	O
world.”	O
[That]	O
scene	O
all	O
took	O
place	O
on	O
Titanic's	O
iconic	O
prow	O
at	O
the	O
very,	O
very	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
ship.	O
We	O
discovered	O
when	O
we	O
reached	O
the	O
wreck	O
last	O
month	O
that	O
the	O
port	O
side	O
railing	O
has	O
fallen	O
off.	O
This	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
natural	O
thing,	O
different	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
railing	O
are	O
getting	O
weaker.	O
But	O
for	O
such	O
a	O
high-profile	O
and	O
highly	O
photographed	O
and	O
iconic	O
railing	O
to	O
now	O
be	O
resting	O
on	O
the	O
ocean	O
floor	O
below,	O
it's	O
a	O
significant	O
change.	O
Titanic	O
will	O
literally	O
never	O
look	O
the	O

But	O
there's	O
something	O
different	O
about	O

What	O
do	O
you	O

it	O

that	O

Penca:	O
You	O

we	O
are	O

We	O
love	O
a	O
good	O
story.	O
And	O
I	O
would	O
put	O
Titanic's	O
life	O
and	O
loss	O
up	O
against	O
any	O
great	O
story,	O
any	O
Hollywood	O

any	O
great	O
novel,	O
a	O
war	O

It	O
is	O
