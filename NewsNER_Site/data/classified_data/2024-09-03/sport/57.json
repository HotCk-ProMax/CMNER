How\u2019s your sex life?\n\nChances are, not so hot. Between endless diaper changes, sleep deprivation, hormonal changes and general exhaustion, new parents don\u2019t have a lot of time or energy for physical intimacy.\n\nAnd even though many doctors give the birthing partner the all-clear to have sex four to six weeks after giving birth, many may not feel ready.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t show love in other ways, says Aaron Steinberg, a couples coach who teaches expecting parents how to \u201cbabyproof\u201d their relationships. Kissing, cuddling and even words of affirmation can \u201ccultivate and nurture the part of your relationship that makes you more than roommates.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nStress and monotony in new parenthood may foster resentment or pull couples apart. But parents who practice intimacy, he says, may emerge from this stage feeling \u201cmore in love, more on a team and even more attracted to each other.\u201d\n\nRelationship experts explain how to keep romance alive in the postpartum period. It will take effort and creativity to stay connected \u2014 but the benefit is worth it, says Steinberg.\n\n\n\n1. Expand your idea of intimacy\n\nWe often think of sex and intimacy as having a singular, binary goal, says Steinberg: orgasm. But sex isn\u2019t always an option or always desired, so it\u2019s important to broaden our idea of intimacy.\n\nDon\u2019t assume that every act of foreplay needs to lead to sex, he says. \u201cCan you feel the pleasure of hand-holding, cuddling or kissing without it needing to go anywhere?\u201d\n\nAnd if you\u2019re craving something more, find other ways to satisfy that desire. Remember, sex is wide-ranging, says relationship scientist and perinatal therapist Shy Porter. Sensual touching (like massages and back rubs), mutual masturbation or oral sex might be more comfortable than penetrative sex in the postpartum period.\n\nPhoto illustration by Becky Harlan/NPR\n\n2. Pretend like you\u2019re dating again\n\nThink about all the ways you showed desire before you and your partner started having sex, says sex educator Shan Boodram, author of The Game of Desire. Joke, flirt, tickle, tease. Put a Post-it note with a sweet message for your partner on the coffee maker. Come home with your partner\u2019s favorite snack.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThis \u201cmay be all the intimate connection\u201d you can manage right now, says Boodram -- and that\u2019s OK. These playful, thoughtful interactions can still keep your romantic bond strong.\n\n3. Tell your partner they\u2019re rocking it\n\nNew parenthood leaves a lot of room for self-doubt. So tell your partner, \u201cWow, you\u2019re really rocking this,\u201d says Boodram. Whether it\u2019s giving your partner props for their swaddling technique or admiring their patience during that 3 a.m. feeding, compliments can be a reminder that you\u2019re on the same team.\n\nWhen you feel supported by your partner \u2014 rather than scolded or second-guessed \u2014 it\u2019s easier to initiate romantic interactions, she says. It opens a \u201cpathway for intimacy and connection because you don't feel as judged.\"\n\nPhoto illustration by Becky Harlan/NPR\n\n4. Commit to date nights\n\nYou don\u2019t have to go out to a fancy dinner, but it\u2019s important to put a dedicated date night or \u201cus\u201d time on the calendar, says Steinberg. Maybe it\u2019s for sex, or maybe it\u2019s just to cuddle in the pillow fort in the living room after baby goes to bed.\n\nScheduling moments for intimacy can give couples something to look forward to and create a necessary, sacred space free from baby or logistics talk, says Porter. \u201cPre-baby, cuddling once a week might seem like not a big deal, but when you're in this new phase of your life, it feels tremendous and so good.\u201d\n\n5. Don\u2019t make your partner guess what you want\n\nDuring the postpartum period, you may be dealing with big changes to your body and identity. And it can be difficult to know what kind of intimacy you need from your partner at this time.\n\n\u201cAsking your partner to guess what you want while also trying to guess what they want is a tall order,\u201d she says. \u201cClosing that gap requires educating yourself.\u201d\n\nSo take the time to identify your turn-ons, says Boodram, whether that\u2019s dirty talk, sensual massages or visual triggers. \u201cWhat is the specific thing you require that turns you from a state of no arousal to arousal being a possibility?\u201d Then communicate that to your partner. It may kickstart a connection in the bedroom.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nYou might find you\u2019re not in a sexual place at all just yet, and that\u2019s alright, says Boodram. \u201cNever think there is a point when you need to [say], \u2018Wow, I'm going to bite the bullet and just do it already.\u2019 \u201d The postpartum period will look different for every couple, so find the practices that work best for you -- and take all the time you need to heal and grow.\n\nYour turn: Intimacy in the postpartum period\n\nWe want to hear from you: How did you and your partner stay romantically connected during the postpartum period?
