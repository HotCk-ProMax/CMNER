more	O
in	O

several	O

Schmidt	O
says	O
that	O
this	O
transition	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
happen	O
much	O
quicker	O
than	O
some	O
may	O
expect.	O
“Autonomy	O
and	O
abundance	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
transform	O
wars	O
very,	O
very	O
quickly,”	O
he	O
told	O
NPR.	O
“The	O
only	O
reason	O
it	O
hasn't	O
happened	O
is,	O
thank	O
goodness,	O
the	O
U.S.	O
is	O
not	O
at	O
war,	O
[but]	O
others	O
are.	O
If	O
you	O
study	O
Ukraine,	O
you	O
see	O
a	O
glimpse	O
of	O
the	O
future.	O
Much	O
of	O
the	O
Kursk	O
invasion	O
that	O
recently	O
happened	O
was	O
due	O
to	O
their	O
ability	O
to	O
use	O
short	O
and	O
mid-range	O
drones	O
to	O
support	O
combined	O
operations	O
on	O
the	O
ground.”	O
Now	O
that	O
the	O
human	O
element	O
of	O
physically	O
being	O
on	O
a	O
battlefield	O
can	O
be	O
replaced	O
by	O
remote	O
operations,	O
Schmidt	O
argues	O
that	O
this	O
will	O
set	O
a	O
new,	O
more	O
precise	O
method	O
of	O
fighting	O
that	O
would	O
also	O
be	O
dramatically	O
less	O
expensive	O
than	O
traditional	O
methods.	O

“I'm	O
worried,	O
of	O
course,	O
that	O
this	O
will	O
ultimately	O
set	O
a	O
new	O
standard	O
and	O
actually	O
lower	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
war.	O
But	O
if	O
you	O
think	O
about	O
it,	O
this	O
technology	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
invented	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
the	O
other,	O
and	O
I'd	O
like	O
it	O
to	O
get	O
invented	O
under	O
U.S.	O
terms.”	O
Feeling	O
underprepared	O
Both	O
Milley	O
and	O
Schmidt	O
say	O
that	O
even	O
if	O
major	O
efforts	O
are	O
made	O
to	O
address	O
this	O
change,	O
the	O
red	O
tape	O
involved	O
with	O
approvals	O
from	O
the	O
Pentagon	O
make	O
it	O
difficult	O
to	O
take	O
quick,	O
effective	O
action.	O
“Not	O
even	O
the	O
president	O
of	O
the	O
United	O
States	O
can	O
fix	O
the	O
procurement	O
process	O
of	O
the	O
Pentagon,”	O
Schmidt	O
said.	O
“The	O
procurement	O
process	O
is	O
designed	O
for	O
weapon	O
systems	O
that	O
take	O
15	O
years.	O
In	O
the	O
Ukraine	O
situation,	O
innovation	O
is	O
occurring	O
on	O
a	O
three	O
to	O
six-week	O
timeline,	O
and	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
find	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
Pentagon	O
on	O
that	O
tempo.	O
The	O
only	O
way	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
is	O
with	O
other	O
authorities	O
and	O
other	O
approaches,	O
and	O
with	O
an	O
understanding	O
that	O
you	O
don't	O
design	O
the	O
product	O
at	O
the	O
beginning	O
and	O
then	O
develop	O
it	O
over	O
five	O
years.	O
You	O
do	O
it	O
incrementally,	O
which	O
is	O
how	O
tech	O
works.”	O
Milley	O
agrees	O
that	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
keep	O
up,	O
entire	O
systems	O
of	O
operating	O
within	O
the	O
military	O
will	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
revolutionized.	O
“We	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
really	O
fundamental	O
change	O
here.	O
And	O
then	O
from	O
that,	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
operational	O
concept.	O
And	O
then	O
from	O
that,	O
you've	O
got	O
to	O
identify	O
the	O
attributes	O
of	O
a	O
future	O
force.	O
And	O
then	O
from	O
that,	O
change	O
the	O
procurement	O
system	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
build	O
the	O
technological	O
capabilities,	O

the	O
training,	O
develop	O
the	O

Our	O
