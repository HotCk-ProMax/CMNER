He raised more than $25 million for the Biden-Harris campaign at a star-studded fundraiser in New York in March followed by another in Los Angeles in June that raised more than $28 million.\n\nObama said that Democrats were \"gonna be underdogs\" in the race and nodded to the need to energize independent voters and young voters.\n\n\"We are telling everybody to kick off those bedroom slippers and get off the couch and start knocking on doors and making phone calls,\" Obama told Harris, according to extended excerpts of the call released by his office.\n\nMichelle Obama told Harris that the \"energy\" surrounding her new campaign has \"really changed the game.\"\n\n\"We've got your back. We have you and Doug's back. It's gonna be a fight. But you know, I think the country is ready for something special,\" Michelle Obama said.\n\nSponsor Message",
